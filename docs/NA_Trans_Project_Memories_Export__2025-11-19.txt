Generated: 2025-11-19T20:34:10.851516

This file captures the persistent project memories / context that have been guiding the NA Powertrain Tuning work
in ChatGPT. Each item roughly corresponds to a saved "memory" entry.

1. Default HP Tuners VCM Scanner channel pack
   - Preferred format: ParameterID-based .channels.xml
   - Default working pack name: TransFAST-FromGreg
   - Core ParameterIDs: [12, 13, 36, 37, 2111, 2113, 2114, 2700, 2701, 2705, 2734–2741, 2746–2749, 2764, 2765, 4501, 4502, 12703–12705].
   - Use 10 ms interval for RPM/shaft speed IDs (12, 13, 12703, 12704, 12705).

2. Canonical AllChannels PID↔Name map
   - Stored under /mnt/data/02_Channel_Maps/ (AllChannels_PID_Name_Map__latest.*).
   - Legacy Spark_* mapping files kept as aliases.
   - Use this map for generating future channels.xml packs.

3. Canonical shift table format
   - Tahoe/HP Tuners format with 17-point throttle axis:
     0, 6, 12, 19, 25, 31, 37, 44, 50, 56, 62, 69, 75, 81, 87, 94, 100.
   - Header line: 'mph ... %'.
   - Row labels like '1 -> 2 Shift', '2 -> 1 Shift'.
   - Generate both UP and DOWN tables in this format.
   - Slip tables are FINAL and must never be modified.

4. Shared project area on disk
   - Canonical path: /mnt/data/Project_Files/NA_Powertrain_Tuning.
   - Important items:
     • ShiftTables_Throttle17/SHIFT_TABLES__Throttle17__HandOff__LATEST.zip
     • SlipTables_HYBRID_5to20/NA_Trans_TCC_SlipTables__HandOff__LATEST.zip
     • Channels/Trans-FAST.channels.xml
   - All use 17-pt throttle axis & 'mph … %' header.

5. Active baseline
   - “cam4350” torque-first neutral starter (Throttle17) is the baseline.
   - Baseline folder: /mnt/data/06_Logs/Trans_Review/BASELINE.
   - Contains the four anchor tables: SHIFT UP/DOWN + TCC APPLY/RELEASE.
   - Default source for Mode B blending.

6. Tahoe vehicle & mods (L83/6L80 project)
   - 2015 Tahoe, 6L80 (T43), 4WD, FD 3.08, 32.5" tire.
   - BTR Stage 1 v2 truck cam (~4350 rpm torque peak, 112 LSA, +4° phaser lockout).
   - L86 intake & throttle, K&N Blackhawk CAI.
   - Speed Engineering shorty headers, MagnaFlow 18" straight-through muffler, 3rd-cat delete.
   - Vacuum pump delete; TBV delete noted.

7. Table resolution policy
   - All SHIFT UP/DOWN and TCC APPLY/RELEASE tables use 0.1 mph resolution.
   - Lockout sentinels 318/317 are preserved exactly (no decimals).

8. Global change policy
   - Always use full Tahoe context (FD, tire, cam, TBV, WOT RPM per gear, current tables).
   - Make changes holistically across entire rows/columns.
   - Enforce:
     • Monotonic TPS across all bins.
     • DOWN < UP hysteresis (per matching TPS bin).
     • WOT guardrail policy (per-gear RPM caps).
     • TCC lockout policy.
     • 0.1 mph formatting with 317/318 preserved.
   - Run full-table audit after any change.

9. Pre-flash audit requirement
   - Full-table audit must run before any flash.
   - Checks:
     • 17-pt TPS header.
     • 0.1 mph formatting + 317/318 preserved.
     • UP/DOWN monotonic across TPS bins.
     • DOWN ≤ UP − 1.0 mph at matching TPS bins.
     • TCC lockout policy.
   - Audit emits “__AUDITFIX__” pack for flashing.

10. SOP: Trans Table Review & Edit
    - Follow “Trans Table Review & Edit” doc for Tahoe L83/6L80.
    - Load full mods file + complete UP/DOWN/TCC tables (Comfort & Performance).
    - Enforce global constraints & WOT guardrails.
    - Run full-table audit → __AUDITFIX__ pack pre-flash.

11. Neutral-first pipeline docs
    - Neutral-first build + FastCache documented under project Docs.
    - Prefer neutral build seeded from torque-first baseline; overlays applied late.

12. Pipeline update (2025-11-08): Extra passes & Corner-Exit
    - Canonical headers: pedal_pct, throttle_pct, gear_actual, gear_cmd, time_s.
    - extra_passes_preflight.py validates coverage (strict/no-fallback).
    - Corner exit passes (core + chassis) produce small DOWN deltas around 8–30 mph.

13. CLEAN_FULL-only pipeline
    - Only __trans_focus__clean_FULL__*.csv is used (no small CLEAN).
    - Directory layout: ./newlogs, ./newlogs/cleaned, ./newlogs/output/00_cleaner, ./newlogs/_staging_Review.
    - All builders/passes read from CLEAN_FULL.

14. INTENT pass locked
    - driver_intent_pass_weighted__PLUS_v3.py is canonical.
    - “REALISTIC” warmed run: ECT/TFT ≥100°F, specific throttle-rate thresholds, small UP deltas, small TCC release deltas.
    - Outputs: INTENT__SHIFT_UP__DELTA.tsv and INTENT__TCC_RELEASE__DELTA.tsv.

15. TCC neutral-first workflow
    - Build TCC_APPLY/RELEASE Throttle17 → overlay_polish_v3 (SHIFT only) → table_audit_and_fix for all four tables.
    - Enforce RELEASE ≥ APPLY +1.1 mph, DOWN ≤ UP −1.0 mph; 0.1 mph rounding; 317/318 preserved.

16. Folder layout for tables
    - SHIFT tables: newlogs/output/01_tables/shift/.
    - TCC tables:  newlogs/output/01_tables/tcc/.
    - Neutral candidate: newlogs/output/01_tables/NEUTRAL_CANDIDATE/.

17. Baseline generation policy
    - Do not use legacy shift/TCC tables.
    - Base schedule from torque-first neutral “cam4350” profile.
    - Style overlays applied only at end, on demand.

18. Preflight & audit scripts
    - Always run neutral audit (assert_neutral_tables_ok.py) and 0.1-mph enforcement.
    - force_1dp scripts for SHIFT/TCC, preserving sentinels.

19. User preference: strict/no-fallback
    - No fallback channels; fail loudly and list missing headers.
    - strict/no-fallback preflight is default for all passes.

20. CORNER pass combination policy
    - Run core & chassis variants then combine via elementwise max into CORNER__SHIFT_DOWN__DELTA__COMBINED.tsv.
    - Default coverage knobs documented (min-hits, speed windows, chassis gates).

21. Pass ordering snapshot
    - Pass order in isolation: CONSIST → CORNER (core+chassis+combine) → LAT → STOPGO → KICKDOWN → CRUISE/TIP-IN → TCC_EDGE.

22. Pass outputs location
    - All pass outputs under newlogs/output/02_passes/<PASS>.

23. TCC EC³ tools
    - Use soft-lock interpretation with tcc_slip_fused or Engine−ISS slip.
    - EC³ thresholds and coverage rules adopted (no TCC deltas unless coverage is adequate).

24. Tahoe mods as source of truth
    - Always consult mods file for WOT shift RPM caps per gear, vehicle parameters, etc.

25. Overlay polish constraints
    - overlay_polish_v3.py runs only on SHIFT tables.
    - table_audit_and_fix + assert_neutral_tables_ok gate TCC separately.

26. Neutral candidate tables
    - Neutral SHIFT UP/DOWN and TCC APPLY/RELEASE built and audited into NEUTRAL_CANDIDATE folder.

27. TCC Fix Pack
    - tcc_table_builder_Throttle17__FIX.py and strict 0.1-mph TCC enforcement.
    - Use tcc_gap_fix__robust last, only as needed for RELEASE ≥ APPLY + 1.1 mph.

28. Conversation name
    - This project thread known internally as “pipeline chat 2”.

29. User preferences
    - User has difficulty typing and poor memory.
    - Prefers single-paste commands and concise, explicit progress messages.
    - Wants persistent, always-up-to-date pipeline docs and snapshots.

30. TSV escape guard
    - tsv_escape_guard.py normalizes headers, fixes literal escapes, enforces 0.1 mph, preserves 317/318.
    - TCC row labels standardized (3rd/4th/5th/6th Apply/Release).

31. Neutral-first, strict/no-fallback runbooks
    - Runbooks live under project Docs; single-paste PowerShell blocks preferred.

32. Slip tables policy
    - 9×9 slip tables are immutable.
    - Always include slip tables in neutral seed ZIP under 01_tables/slip/.

33. Script-list preference
    - Keep a running list of active pipeline scripts on request so user can zip/archive them.

34. Project snapshot tracking
    - Maintain snapshots of pipeline state, passes, and outputs with dates.
    - Provide one-paste commands to reproduce runs.

35. LOG-FIRST policy
    - Derive schedules from logs wherever possible.
    - Neutral/Mode B blending is optional and off by default unless requested.

36. Pass checklist
    - Track CONSIST, STOPGO, KICKDOWN, CORNER, LAT, INTENT, TCC_EDGE and note which use Tahoe-specific thresholds and BESTINTERP.

37. TCC EC³ update (slip thresholds)
    - Soft-lock defined as |slip| ≤ 50 rpm; unlock as |slip| ≥ 120 rpm, for gears 3–6, speed ≥25 mph, no temp gating by default.

38. RAW_PREFILTER_GENERIC note
    - Future Stage -1 pre-clean step to trim large “Greg” logs to smaller channel subsets before CLEAN_FULL.

39. Subproject name: RAW_PREFILTER_GENERIC
    - Same as 38; a placeholder for future work.

40. Long-term tune goals
    - Two main tunes: Comfort (ultra-plush GT) and Performance (max-aggressive but safe).
    - User is flexible on TCC lock rules; durability prioritized.

41. Converter hardware
    - Stock single-disc EC3 converter (no high-stall aftermarket converter).

42. Sean Boyle video series
    - Treat 6L80 HP Tuners experiment videos as key external knowledge; includes Tecum, AFL, line pressure, clutch control insights.

43. Reference library (2025-11-19 additions)
    - Engine.pdf, Transmission.pdf, Driveline-Axle.pdf, General Information.pdf.
    - EC³ Torque Converter Clutch Strategy PDF and Shift Quality Metrics PDF.
    - transcripts.txt (video transcripts) and trans_service.txt (service notes).
    - Slip tables how-to pack ZIPs (non-browsable via myfiles tool but present on disk).

44. Project vs non-project chats
    - User prefers to work in regular chats (not Projects) so GitHub and other connectors are available.

45. Always-updated pipeline snapshot
    - Maintain a living description of pipeline scripts, outputs, and folders for the user.

46. Harshness & metrics work
    - Metrics doc (shift quality/harshness) used to guide future passes and evaluations.

47. TCC EC³ heavy-SUV strategy
    - Strategy doc (EC³ torque converter clutch in a heavy SUV) guides TCC APPLY/RELEASE in Comfort vs Performance.

48. Export preference
    - User wants the ability to export notes, docs, and pipeline state into files/zips they can move to new chats or tools.

End of memory export.
