warning tuning your vehicle can be a dangerous activity and there is substantial risk involved the dangers
include but are not limited to permanently damaging your vehicle injury or death to yourself or other people
damaging personal property due to paying attention to a laptop while driving this
video is intended for educational purposes only before altering the
calibration of your vehicle you should verify it is in proper working and mechanical condition have a working
basis of knowledge of how your vehicle works and how the components interrelate and understand how your tuning software
works bottom line you and only you are responsible for making your own
decisions as well as accepting the consequences of those decisions I cannot
be held accountable for your actions alright guys welcome back to the shop
this collection of pixels of mine I will share with you today today we're going
to be talking about shift scheduling in other words when does the 6l80e shift
this is actually broken down into two parts so we have the part throttle shift
over here and then we have the Full Throttle over here if we look at the up shift we can see
that it is controlled by two things we have the throttle position and then we have the miles per hour and this is
going to tell us when the shift is commanded Full Throttle we can take throttle out of the equation but we have
miles per hour and then we also have the RPMs that will command when the shift
will happen so we'll break these down and talk about both parts so as normal when I go through these
videos I have the OEM tune pulled up and then I'm comparing it against mine so
all of these green cells that you see those are ones that have edited or been
changed from stock and then if you followed along up to
this point you've know that I kind of always want to keep my transmission consistent I don't ever want to enter a
condition of oh my in sport mode or tap up tap down and it's doing something a
little bit differently everything's consistent at least till the torque converter and then we're going to talk
about that in the next video but otherwise all the gear shifting the pressures time I want to make it exactly
the same so I've basically set this normal up how I wanted it then I've copied it to A and
B I don't remember what I did with hot but apparently I've changed it in the past tap up tap Downs uh specialty thing
that we're going to talk about here at the end but let's let's knock out the normal part throttle shifts
so I've taken the Liberty of copying this stuff out the stock and mine and I've put it into this
spreadsheet so here's a tab for the OEM values and then my values and then I just graphed
them out to take a look at these things so on the left side we can see the OEM and there's a few things that right away
jump out to me that man this is this is questionable like why why is it set up
this way the first one is you can see we have overlapping downshift and upshift areas now when you think about this
um when you are driving and say our current envelope we're right
here which is you know our our mod the combination of our miles per hour and throttle pedal when you hit the gas
pedal to go faster it goes fast it's going to shoot over to the right your speed will come up a
little bit but by and large you're going to be kind of doing one of these things and so you're going to cross a few of
these boundaries when you have these overlaps this is like confusion
okay and so this is what I call crossing the streams and this is what you get and
what's a super common complaint of the 6l80e you know it wants to shift but it
doesn't know if it wants to shift it can't decide if it wants to shift sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't it just doesn't know what it wants to do
it's kind of wishy-washy well I found in one of my logs for my testing this exact
scenario and you can see this yellow line represents I'm in first gear it says hey let's go to SEC nope let's we
need to go back down to First oh wait hang on I was wrong we need to get back into second gear
so this is the kind of stuff that you want to avoid so when we look at this you can see that I've clearly separated
out these boundaries try to keep them you know a nice distance between them and certainly no overlapping
the other thing and this is just an OCD thing uh you can see if you squint
really hard this dotted line and by the way the dotted lines represent the downshift this dotted line goes down
and so you know probably I don't know maybe I'm the only one that
notices this but if we look at this we can see
initially a zero percent throttle it says downshift at 4.9 miles an hour but
they're on out it drops to 4.6 I mean granted it's 0.3 miles an hour but this
is just kind of some weird sloppy stuff that why is how does that stuff even creep into the factory tune we I mean I
expect better maybe not everybody has the same expectations at me but it's a
little bit off to me I think um and then the overdrive you can see we
still have some crossing of the streams at least on my car obviously your vehicle most likely will be different
from the factory calibration um but you know why are these shapes they just don't seem to really match up
and so I kind of more closely mirrored the shapes over here
um so the other thing that I'll talk about is the overall shape and the
starting points and ending points here so the left side I've basically kept the
factory whatever the minimum speed is for each gear that's something that I've kept even though I have kind of a Rowdy
cam um it still seems to do just fine so I left that
the ending part is where we're going to connect essentially and we're going to have continuity between part throttle
and wide open throttle stuff and we'll get to that in a second but we're going to need to do separate testing on that
but the metal part you see I kind of have these nice gentle swooping S curves and so for me if you've listened to the
Past videos I kind of talk about you know I I have two modes that I drive my car in one is
um I'm in town you know I'm trying to be quiet trying to be a good citizen it's a loud exhaust
it's got a big cam it's got a big stall getting off the line is a little bit of
a noisy affair right and I'm not trying to give hot Riders a bad name and sometimes I just want to drive and not
cause a big Ruckus and that's what these s-curves are so on the left side is a
really gentle you know the invisible one two three shifts get you going get you moving without a whole lot of ruckus but
then as soon as you start giving it throttle you can see that these kind of exponentially grow
and they get a lot more harder to command that up shift and so that's where you get the aggression and which
is the other side of my driving is I'm beating on this thing and I expect it to perform so to me this is a perfect blend
of both of those worlds and you can look over here on this particular shift this three four shift it's pretty much a
straight line and pretty much same thing for this uh was this two three shift as well and I kind of went down that route
of having more linear straight lines um and it just I didn't like it as much
so this is all also going to come into play as you dial this stuff in and
you're going to have to do this in combination with your torque management and shift timing to get what you like
but generally once you get get these speeds dialed in the way you want it you're going to leave them alone this
isn't something that you're going to spend a lot of time tweaking on but just get them right and you'll be good
um all right so now let's talk about the Full Throttle shifts so this is going to be
something that you're definitely going to be required to do some testing on so here's some of the testing that I did
from quite a while back now first of all after I rebuilt the
engine you know I pretty sure I can get away with say a
7200 RPM shift point but I wanted to be a little bit more conservative so I
decided 6900 RPM sounds pretty safe to me so and these graphs
you can see that I've set a reference line for 6 900 RPMs so this is my goal
I'm looking at here and I want basically this RPM to hit that dotted line every
single time and so it goes without saying at this point
you're going to have to have the rest of your tune dialed in your timing your fuel like you need a safe tune something
you can count on before you start beating on this thing at wide open throttle start optimizing your shift
points so get that taken care of and then decide on your shift point we'll talk
about Optimum shift points here in a few minutes but at this point you can see like this
shift right our 2 3 shift looks like man it's golden um the one two probably not the most
reliable data in here and you may have some of these issues on the street like you can see the RPM jumps right so there
was some there are some traction issues here which is why it it's acting goofy
and you may have those same issues on the street you're going to have to figure out you know work on the shifts
that you can then backtrack to the other shifts that need attention on my car trying to do a full throttle one two
shift is impossible on the street tires just spin it's crazy
once you get into the higher gears it's going to be a little bit easier so how does this work then
now this is going to be uh you're probably gonna have to do a few of these polls um just due to like you can even see
this we got some slipping right here we got this little jump in the RPMs
so either way you're gonna probably have to do this a few times to get this dialed
in just due to your converter slippage now that's that's assuming you have a
high stall converter so for that how do you do that so uh I
just use cross multiplication you can do the same thing it works pretty good but basically you're going to find a shift
point on your graph that didn't meet your requirements and so you're going to
do your testing or what you observed your miles per hour to be which in this case is 126 miles per hour and then at
what RPM did that shift occur 65 16 and all I did was I just if we go back to
this log I just kind of drag this until I'm trying to find the highest RPMs
and then once I find that I lock it here so 65 16 126 and I plug that in here and
I said okay well I actually want it to shift a 6900 RPMs so at this point
whether you call it cross multiplication or proportions or just you know ratios
whatever you can take 6 900 RPMs multiply by 126 and divided by 65 16 and
that gives us a new Target of 133 miles per hour and so again do the weight due to your
cam due to your converter due to your speed which is wind resistance due to your gearing all of these things are
going to take an impact or a factor that you're not just going to command whatever RPMs you want to shift at wide
open throttle so when we come into here to these wide open tables
and if we go down to fifth
and six now actually my car won't ever shift into six gear at wide open throttle
you notice I've maxed that out to 318 miles an hour now I have what is it y
rated speed rating on my tires 186 miles per hour but you know centrifugal force
blows tires apart there is no reason to be really doing wide open throttle
shifting even into fifth gear on public roads I I like going fast as the next
guy but seriously be safe out there I mean have some type of Common Sense
either way but you can see now all of these shifts are at different RPMs and
that's because we need a little bit of a different lead time so as you go through and you cross
multiply you can see 33 58.93 well what do I have
over here 33 58 93.
so for all of these wide open shifts as you go and cross multiply and you you iron these out you're going to have to
meet up your end points on your normal shift tables you know you're up shift fifth up shift
six like all of these items you're going to want to basically as we go down in here
this end point needs to match this is the part throttle table needs to match where the wide open
throttle begins you want that consistency and no hiccups then this is what you're going to need to have
so once you do that you should be good to go
so a lot of this may seem a little bit daunting uh but it's not that bad I
think you get in here and you practice a little bit you'll get the hang of it not a big deal
but if you're new to it and you want a little bit of help blue cat back in the day wrote this tool this trans tool it's
like bctrans.exe check the video description I'm going to put a link to my Google
Drive as always with all kinds of tuning files and information I'll be sure to put this in here you can I think it's on
Camaro 5. the latest version is 1.73 so if you have something older make sure
that you upgrade so I'm going to walk you through this a little bit this isn't made to be an end-all be-all walkthrough
of this but it's something there's there used to be a great video out there that went over this in depth but again that
channel is gone the video is gone so I want to get you started at least get you on the basics that you could feel
comfortable using this so when you first open it you're going to set it to 6l80
that's what we're talking about we have six gears our vehicle speed sensor has
36 pulses if we look in here you can see 36 so we're good and then we
have the gear ratios listed here and so you can go back into trans
gear ratios and you know it's pretty close there's a few decimals off I don't
know that it's really worth sweating the details but you can confirm and you can even edit it if you want to
the max speeds if you hover over this stuff you will get a tool tip display and so this is basically saying hey
don't change it it's just for reference so in my case let's say well I want to shift actually at 6 900 RPMs
so I'm just going to change all of these guys and this tool will get you in the
ballpark it's not going to be a home run right but it should be a really good starting point
so then it says okay well what's your final gear and again if we look in Speedo I have 327 I think some trucks
it's a mismatch what your actual gear is versus what HP tuner says or the factory
calibration so be aware of that 26 and a half was my
tire my idle is 700. and then this guy again you can read all
that my stall converter got 3600 stall
I don't ever lock it up until fifth gear and lock up config
again I have a single disc converter so I never want to lock it at wide open throttle
so I don't know if we can disable this somehow
um but we're going to talk about the torque converter in a subsequent video but the
option is there to mess around with it now you're going to pick the car closest to you I have a Chevy SS which is a
Holden Commodore and the G8 is a hold in Commodore so we're going to pick that and now this factor and offset and up
and down this is you know if you remember me talking about that S curve this is going to be how you can dial
this in with these numbers um you know I haven't really used this tool much I used it at first and I
quickly migrated away from it just because it's hard for me to see I'd
rather have like having these 2D graphs I think is great
maybe okay well that totally disappeared on me but
I like being able to look at these graphs on here you know and you can drag and move these things up as you want to
um and it kind of helps you get dialed into kind of the ZIP code that you want to to make this work
so I find this a little bit harder like what is this doing exactly like you can look here and kind of see
if you are Rain Man and you can look at all these numbers and memorize them
um and again you know hover over it it's going to tell you a little bit
but either way you're going to get this kind of set up how maybe you think you have an initial
solution for this this point now you're going to go to export and you get to the export window
and so now you have it says main shift table now each operating system is going
to be a little bit different so if I go to my up shift
and then my downshift that's two tables but here it's saying is it's one so you're gonna have to like
copy out if you do a copy table it's going to do the whole thing we don't want that so
now we do copy and come in here and paste it and then we'll do the downshift side
and go through there and now we're going to hit next and so this is fifth again I have up
shift Fifth and I have downshift fifth are two different tables so I'm going to copy this guy
I'm going to copy this guy paste it in there and so basically and
if you have a two column wide open um because I think some of them uh you have
upshift and downshift next to each other so you can format it when you get to those tables so if we keep hitting next
you're just going to keep copying all of these things out so there's I'm talking about as far as a two column table which
I don't have maybe you do but either way you can do that so you're just going to keep hitting next and copying this stuff
over and after we get through the shift scheduling and wide open we're going to hit some of the torque converter tables
so this would be first gear you know like one through three it's not locking
up and then we get to fifth gear and this is the lock and unlock and so you know you would just go to your torque
converter and come to apply a release and then you could start popping these things over
so again be patient we'll get the torque converters next but I just wanted while we're talking about it give you a
rundown of this tool so you're just going to keep hitting next and looking at whatever it's telling you up here to
copy and you're just going to move these things in I think this is a great starting point But ultimately your butt butt feel your
butt Dyno is going to be a much better calibration for what's right what feels
good what does the car want to do it's just software um so use it as a starting point but
make sure you Branch out from there um I think
that's the main thing that I wanted to cover today but let's talk about a
couple other things real quick so number one let's talk about one other a few other things as far as
hacks so tap up tap down so we have the factory says up down
request is enabled so on my car it's a stick in the console and you know you
pull it down toward you to get into drive and then it also has sport mode and for that you just kind of knock it
over to the right and it goes into sport mode and then from there if you want to
go into tap up tap down or you know manual shifting then you can start rocking it back and forth
I don't really like that I've found too many times where it's like hey I'm anticipating getting in a race or I'm
gonna go around a corner in a second the last thing I want this transmission to do is up shift by itself and then I need
to manually command to downshift and RPMs are going to flare and get crazy
um I would just rather skip sport mode altogether and so in my scenario I've
just disabled this here and so now as soon as I knock that stick over into
what used to be sport mode it's automatically tap up tap down and you
inherit the transmission at whatever gear it's in so if I'm cruising off the
stoplight and I make it to third gear and I say don't shift ever again until I tell you
I just flip that stick over to sport mode which is deleted it's now tap up tap down I get the transmission in
manual mode and third gear I'm ready to go Full Throttle or do whatever crazy shenanigans that I need to do and I
don't have to worry about commanding an up or downshift to force it to get into manual mode I really like this
now as far as other hacks for the shift scheduling for tap up tap down
if we look in the factory tune we can see it says first gear
if you're in tap up tap down go ahead and make that second gear shift as soon as you hit 47 miles an hour
that is impossible with the factory gearing you'll never hit 47 miles an hour in first so basically it's never
going to shift by itself same thing for second gear you're never going to hit 75 it's never going to automatically shift
and then same thing for three to four you cannot hit 115.
so what I've done is my wide open shifting if I come into
here let's get rid of the graph
yeah so this is my normal wide open shifting 33 58 and 93 miles an hour I've
copied those over to the last three cells now I've tried this
at just putting it at 100 so you know like this
well if I can get this guy well I can't copy because I'm in compare
one but either way it was I just set the last column to 100 100 to these values
and it didn't work so you're going to need to have it maybe I didn't try it in two columns but I know for sure it works
as long as the last three columns are set and so this is going to save you some embarrassment and maybe some lost
races so if you have gone into manual mode and you've forgotten to up shift that
red line or wherever it is this is going to say man I got your back I will shift for you you're not going to
hit the rev limiter and the chances of you losing a race is greatly reduced so
this is a lifesaver put these in here and you can see I've also done the same thing for up shift for fifth
well I just max that out so it won't even shift into fifth that wide open
throttle again for safety who needs that so at least for the the normal gears
that you're always going to be in this is a huge thing that I love doing now the other thing by the way drives me
crazy on the factory tune if we go over here to the downshift
you'll notice and this is from my understanding this is the same way on the g8s as the Chevy SS I don't know
about the Camaro Corvettes trucks SUVs so on and so forth but the 2-1 downshift was commanded at
zero miles per hour in other words you're in tap up tap down and you're slowing down to a stoplight
it will never shift downshift into first gear it will downshift to second gear
and stay in second gear and then when you take off from the light you leave it in second
super annoying so if you bump this up and set it to five
now it will automatically downshift into fifth gear so the way essentially I have this setup
in general is manual mode tap up tap down kind of
reads my mind I put it over here I delete sport mode and by the way if you're a canyon Carver do an autocross
or something you probably don't want to delete sport mode but Street driving drag racing heck yeah do it I love it
so we have this sport mode deleted and then you know tap up tap down kind of reads your mind it's basically saying at
the extremities of the throttle it should do what it should do which is up
shift when it needs to and downshift when it needs to I mean you don't want to be you know idling coasting down in
sixth gear and not have it downshift that's lame because then when you go Full Throttle you're not going to go
anywhere so this is a lifesaver highly recommend doing that as well so make sure that you
touch up all of these tables and make sure that they match get them where you want to
all right so let's talk about a little bit more of an advanced topic which is going to be
Optimum shift points for wide open throttle so I've done a kind of a basic sketch
here and you can see we have the axis of time and acceleration so as you're accelerating assuming you
never lift the throttle this is probably what you're going to experience a lot of acceleration a plateau and then
underwhelming performance as you are pulling too many RPMs and you're not generating power and so this is kind of
what it's going to kind of feel like and so really in my opinion and there's there's
lots of stuff out there if you go out there and you look to find Optimum shift points they're going to have you looking
at you know Dyno graphs and all this other kinds of stuff and there may be some value in that but at the end of the
day physics B physics and you can tell when the car is pulling is the g-forces the
g-forces are indicating that the car is accelerating or not and I think that's
the best way to identify when is the best time to shift so in
this case you can see third gear I mean our our g-forces are getting smaller but
guess what they're still positive g-forces and so if I'm going to shift down into a much lower RPMs into fourth
year I have to now build those RPMs back up to before I can even get to a break
even or a match point of this so why would I want to trade More g-forces For
Less g-forces not not good the opposite you can get upside down and
you can wait too long which is hey third gear is petered out and now finally I
can up shift well you've waited too long we don't want to do that either the ideal scenario is we want to be even
Steven we're just the perfect handoff hey I'm ready to give it to you you can take over where I left off everything is
nice and perfect well how can you do that um so there are a couple ways one you
know everybody's got smartphones you can get apps on your phone like the torque app is free and I'm sure there's others
out there that you can measure and record g-forces um and you know you don't even need the
OBD2 dongle for that but it'll log out to a CSV file and you can see what those
are doing now it might be kind of hard to match those up to when a shift actually occurred but if you did have an
OBD2 dongle you could at least get the RPMs and kind of compare from there
you can also in HP tuners build your own acceleration math parameter so I'll show
you what I have very simple we have the vehicle speed in my case
miles per hour and I'm looking back a quarter of a second that's milliseconds
so 0.125 seconds an eighth of a second backwards and an eighth of a second
forward so a total of a quarter of a second we're averaging the speed
and you can play with this number like you could bump it up to plus or minus 1000 which would be one second which is
going to give you a nice smooth swooping curve but in this case we're looking at
a trip I did at the drag strip and one second is just it's too smooth and Too Perfect
so if we look in here let's add it let's see what what we have
so max um put in six
decimals we'll put in one let's take a look at this so now this is Jagged line so you're
going to have to kind of manually visually filter through this but let's take a look we can see here we're in
first gear and here we're seconds so let's look at this first gear shift
so you can see that we have some funky data here going on so we need to decide
well is this the last valid bit of data or maybe this one so we'll look it's
either 2.5 I'm looking over here it's either 2.5 or 2.6 and now we need
to say okay well at what point did second gear take over did we get valid data so about in here
so 2.3 to 2.4 so honestly you know pretty impressed with myself that's not
I mean that's pretty close it's not perfect and I think in all cases I've kind of figured out that I'm I'm shifting way
too early and but again I don't want to rev this thing out it's four-door
streetcar weekend car fun car it's not a dedicated drag strip car so I'm not trying to shift at 8000 RPM so 6900 is
plenty fine for me now when we come over here it gets a little bit fuzzier
so what is the last bit of valid data over here maybe 1.5
and then we come over here well where's the first valid data
maybe over here 1.8 so not bad but pretty close we traded
1.5 for 1.8 not perfect ideally they would be the same but this is how you're
going to kind of go through and at least get a rough idea of if you have a good shift spot
and Just for kicks we'll edit this thing
and I'll show you if you make these numbers too big it makes for a nice pretty graph but
kind of hard to read
that's to force it to refresh
[Music] so there you go so
one second I mean look at that that's nice gorgeous data but where did the
shift occur like it's always going down like you can't really tell where the good spots are
so but you can play with that formula and see what works for you and kind of log and see what it's like obviously
there's other apps like draggy um it will give you the broad picture of everything lumped together but as far as
individual gear shifts I don't know the dragging is really going to help too much but at least it does provide some
type of objective data time wise of what's better or not but still you're
going to be at the mercy of whatever traction and whether are available this is going to be hard to compare run to
run where GeForce is GeForce you can tell in that same run did you trade more
g-forces for less or vice versa so hopefully that'll help you get stuff dialed in for wide open throttle
You said:
wow thats great! can you start a note with that info, and im going to get you more transcripts to gather and review if thats ok
You said:
hey what's up guys I just wanted to
check in with you with uh some custom
math that I've been working on and find
it pretty handy I thought you might like
it too basically it's kind of uh just a
modification on whatever the current
gear is you can see it says 5.0 and you
notice this little Ridge here now it
says 5.1 well what ises 5.0 and gear 5.1
mean well that's actually just a little
indicator whether or not the torque
converter is locked up so it's pretty
handy I found um if if you just glance
down you know you can see if it's 0 Z
you know converter is not locked and if
it jumps up to one then you know that it
is locked and this is actually a pretty
simple formula so I'll show you the math
for it and I'll post a math in uh the
video description you can copy it uh
let's see where did it go it's around
here
somewhere I've lost it Gear with TCC so
this is pretty simple formula right so
this is just this middle part here is
saying in this case we're dealing with
kPa but if the line pressure is over 100
kPa that's kind of a random value I
chose high enough to indicate that it is
locking or trying to lock if it's
greater than 100 return a one otherwise
don't return one it'll return a zero and
then that whole thing is just divided by
10 so 0 divided 10 is going to be zero 1
divided 10 is going to be 0.1 and then
we just what take whatever that value is
and we'll add it to the current gear
number and then voila you have 5.0 or
5.1 whatever the case may be so
obviously this line pressure is going to
be a different PID
number depending on your platform and
this should work for just about any
vehicle I would imagine so there's other
variations you could use but uh anyway
give it a shot if you and by the way if
you have some other cool math tricks uh
leave it in the comments because um I'd
like to know what you got all right hope
hope this helps you later

You said:
thank you
hey my fellow Kings and the horsepower
realm welcome back to Silver surfer's
garage today is a Father's Day special
and we're gonna be poking around in the
nether regions of HP tuners so today I
want to cover some tips and tricks that
I found it has saved me numerous times I
can't even tell you how much I've messed
up and how much this stuff has saved me
it's also saved me time and saved me
from making mistakes in the first place
so this applies you know normally I talk
about just Gen 4 stuff e38s my backyard
LS whatever but this is really going to
apply for HP tuners in general
so I have a file open here called new so
let's compare it against old all right
and you can see no surprise we have all
of these green boxes showing us
everything that has changed
so what happens if we want to start
copying stuff over
well one thing I recently learned is if
I toggle over here to show compare file
I cannot highlight
and copy this over right but I can right
click and copy
and now I can come over here I'll delete
that out and I can do paste and look at
that and it does even preserve the RPM
but if I click out of there it brings it
back
all right so that's one option
for doing something if we just have a
simple field that we want to change
but what about when we want to deal with
tables for instance how do we want to
handle that
well we can do it manually all right so
I could copy or highlight this whole
thing
and notice I click up here it selects
the whole table I see a lot of people
manually selecting this for small tables
that's probably fine but when you get
into larger tables that's kind of a real
pain
I prefer the keyboard if I can do
control a on my keyboard because guess
what my fingers are right there I can do
control C which saves me a ton of time
from having to right click and then hit
copy
um so now we can come back over here and
the other mind-blowing thing that I see
is people want to highlight the entire
table that they want to paste into like
windows isn't smart enough to know
unless you highlight it it can't paste
into it that's not true as long as
you've selected the top left item and
I'm going to do control V on the
keyboard that paste it in there I mean
you could again go the slow way right
click and paste but control V does the
same thing so that's one way to do
something for copying tables another
really interesting way that I've learned
is you know you can toggle between the
current view the old View and then this
one shows you the differences
so we can infer to HP tuners hey I don't
want there to be any differences so I
can highlight the entire table
come up here hit zero difference and
then hit equals and guess what that
copied it over both tables are now
exactly the same which is pretty cool I
think
in my opinion but there is yet an even
better way so if we ever get into a
situation where we have to compare two
files that have a lot of differences
and we need to copy a bunch of stuff
over so maybe you're making more broad
sweeping changes in terms of maybe you
know copying over some E85 settings or
some you know just a larger collection
of things right
you can come up to compare and you can
do compare view comparison log
and I don't like the way that it starts
out everything expanded I like to click
this and then I can dig into the certain
areas that I want to and so we can go
into engine
and then you notice we have different
sections for RPM and airflow
so for throttle follower I could say
yeah I want this guy let me copy over
select the difference
boom we're good but this is also a
hierarchical view so I could right click
this airflow and do copy over selected
differences and it would get
both of these guys or if I just
highlight the entire idle
or the entire engine so like if I do
idle copy over it did everything and
then if I right click engine induce
selected then it does all of the engine
as well
but just be aware that if you right
click and do all differences
is going to get everything and most
likely you don't want to do that
especially if you're copying between
different operating systems that could
lead to errors I don't really like that
copy all but it does exist but let's say
we did it for good or bad maybe it was
an accident and then maybe we say you
know what also I'm gonna hit save
now we're in trouble there is no Global
undo right how do we undo all of those
changes and this perhaps
is one of the coolest things that I've
learned in the edit menu there is the
view change and history logs
when I click on this
there are actually two tabs up here
current unsaved which this is going to
show you all of the stuff that you've
changed and haven't saved so if I just
change this to one for instance
come over here and hit refresh there it
is Max idle speed Max idle speed it's
telling you that it has changed but this
guy is a complete database of all of the
changes that have ever been made in this
file since the beginning of time this is
crazy why aren't these in this case why
is this HP tuners file just a few
kilobytes
this thing should be gigabytes like it
has so much information in there
so here I am I made this change today I
hit save how do I undo it check this out
I can't expand in here and I can you
know look at all of these changes that I
did but if I want to revert back to this
one guess what I'm going to right click
and I could open in New but guess what I
can straight up compare this file
against itself
boom check that out and now I can go
back to view or sorry view comparison
log and look at all this stuff and I can
say now I do need to copy over
everything and hit save and now we're
back to our original so if I do back to
open compare and do old all of the
original stuff is here of how I started
this is pretty amazing because what
happens to me
you know I go out I collect the log I
get so excited to get back in the shop
and look at that log and roll in some
changes to the new file
but I forgot to do a save as right you
know so I'm I'm updating the tune and
then I hit save on the old tune file and
I like to keep all of my iTunes files
separate I increment them you like
software versions like 13.0
13.01 13.02 so that way all of the log
files are named the same way and I can
always have a perfect match between
One log file and one tune file and I can
always refer back to them and and take a
look at what was good what was bad what
went wrong all that kind of stuff so
that has saved me but before I learned
that the way I did this was all of my HB
tuners files whether it was a tune file
or a log file that it was always saved
into my Google Drive and I still do this
and this has saved me many times back in
the day
I don't really use it as much now that I
know that HP tuners has the ability to
track this stuff internally but still I
find myself using this some on occasion
so for this one
if I right click now I'm on Windows 11
so I have to do show more options
and now I can look at manage versions
and so here we go I hit save on this
particular file four times and I could
double click it
and that's just going to open up in HP
tuners as its own separate file or you
know whatever you can see the funky
naming convention up here but I can also
right click and there is a restore
version in here somewhere
now restore previous versions and you
can also do the same thing if you go to
the web interface like drive.google.com
there's a managed versions in there
so this is super powerful and one nice
thing even though that I I don't really
need this for the HPT files itself
what I get what happens to me all the
time is I get into the scanner and I
change my channel list or I change my
layout or graphs or something and I hit
save on accident and then I'm like man I
had so much invested in that old layout
and I don't want to recreate it so I can
restore those XML files so all of those
also stay on my Google Drive as well
which is super handy and super
convenient
um so I hope these tips have make sense
to you and is something that you can use
and incorporate and if you have your own
tips or tricks for HP tuners how to use
stuff I would love to know those as well
so please chime in let me know and until
next time onwards and upwards my dudes
all right dang it I I hate to do this to
you at the risk of turning this channel
into one of those stupid five-minute
crafts things where they save the day
with a nine volt battery and you know
some wire and and hot glue
uh I'm gonna show you this just because
I think it's pretty cool I recently
learned this I hate jack stands I don't
like using them but every once in a
while man you just need to use them and
here's what happens you go to grab them
and
really that sucks but check this out
ho ho
well you notice
there is a little Channel and a little
termination for the channel
and if you just bend that tab in there
voila
like magic boys
so hopefully that's something you can
use too in your life anyway sorry about
that don't mean to be a dork back to
your normally scheduled program

alright guys welcome back to my computer
screen today I'm going to kick off a
multi-part series that's going to go
really deep dive and in depth into the
6l80e transmission
there's a ton of stuff out there on the
engine side but where I feel things are
really lacking is the transmission side
and you can get bits and pieces here and
there but it's all just like oh try this
setting try this but nothing that really
synergistically you know ties the whole
room together man and so that is what
I'm trying to do today there was a great
video about a year ago a guy put
together going through a lot of the
settings
um and even the blue cat transmission
tool but those videos are gone I don't
remember the channel name but I suspect
the entire channel has been deleted
so I kind of want to explain everything
I'm going to show you a factory tune
where my tune is it's taken me like a
year and a half of research tying all
kinds of things together to get this
tune that I'm finally happy with I'm a
little bit picky I don't like to just
get it close enough and call it a day it
needs to be perfect otherwise I'm I'm
never going to be happy
I'll show you my tune I don't care
there's nothing really Secret in there
as far as I'm concerned you can copy it
if you want but my goal really is to
give you a strategy
of once you know how to how all this
stuff ties together to give you a
strategy on how you can tactically apply
that knowledge and work up your own tune
so before we go
um I will give you a little tidbit now
we're going to jump in the transmission
again this is a 6l80e controlled by a
t43
um so if you are an otherwise stock form
and for all this series I'm going to
suggest start out
and with your stock transmission tune
and work it up from there so if assuming
you've done that
what you're going to need to do is
you're going to go into torque
management
and up shift and all these values are
set by stock this is one this is your
torque reduction it's saying use a
hundred percent of the torque reduction
but this is you know for us not only is
it for a safe shift for the transmission
but also a relatively soft and smooth
shift so you know your mother-in-law
driving to wherever is not going to
upset the apple cart with the rough
shift so first thing you can do is just
change these cut them in half
to 50 point five is going to say only
use half of that all these other ones
cold multiplier the adder and Adder
modifier just leave those stock right
off the Hop this is going to take out
half of uh your torque reduction the
next thing I would suggest that you do
is this speed control terminate
um
Factory it's probably going to be torque
ramp and this is going to go back to
that smooth shift and this is what
happens after the shift is done how are
we going to get back on we've reduced
the torque now we need to add torque
back in so the torque ramp is going to
say hey let's just add it slowly and
positively at just a nice linear ramp to
get things back up but I would say
change it to immediate so timing has
reduced during the shift to a flat line
and then immediate's going to say all
right let's get back on it and it's
going to immediately jump back up to
what it was
so there's no delay and no waiting and
just the combination of those two things
again on an otherwise stock tune is
going to make things a lot more better
for you now in the long run we're going
to change this torque management value
back to one in a future video but for
now if if you're just starting out and
you're saying you know I have a stock
build I don't care about drag racing or
anything but I I just kind of want a
little bit more firmness and a little
bit crisper feeling transmission these
things are going to do great for you but
we have a lot to discuss of what goes
into torque reduction and we will get to
that but for now this should get you
going until you have the knowledge and
confidence to change all of the other
all of the other settings and feel
comfortable with that so anyway stick
with me glad you're around I hope you
got something out of this today we've
got a ton more information and videos
planned to go kind of over every single
tab in here and explain how all of this
stuff works together so thanks for your
time see you next time

Introduction
manifesto Treatise compendium comprehensive guide everything you need
to know to live by and die by the 6l80e well maybe not all of that but I hope to
to get most of that goal in here so before we start I want to talk about the first thing some the most important
thing I think probably for this transmission and to do that I'm going to use an
analogy you've all seen the post on a forum or in Facebook or wherever where someone chimes in
and they say hey I just bought this car I'm new to the platform what do I need
to do to go faster and then some jackwagon will say oh buy a buy a cold
air intake you know add five horsepower and then someone will say long tubes and
someone will say I'll buy a supercharger and then someone said hey buy a turbo charger those are all viable things but then you
have the old wise man the Chimes in it says well what is your goal and what is your budget you just want to drive
around on the street and have something that sounds decent or you want like a seven second dragster or something and
how much money you got to spend right well that same thinking really applies to this transmission a goal in a budget
our goal is the shift time the next part that goes into that is
well how do we achieve that shift time and that is through pressure back in the old days your grand Pappy's
Ford F-150 he'd throw a shift kit in it and you know like I'm so cool it barks the tires every time I shift but that's
no good that's how you wear out parts and you know it's it's not the best way
to go about it so uh pressure is a bad thing we don't want pressure we only want the least
amount of pressure we need to hit that shift time and no more no less more
pressure is going to lead to damage so use as little as possible and that's what the adaptives are love them or hate
them and the adapters have got a bad name but we'll dig into that I mean
they're a good thing you just need to know how to talk to them and make them sing for you so in the end
less is more all right so let's start digging into
these settings and see what we can uh kind of trouble we can get into actually I'm kidding we want to avoid the trouble
now it goes without saying as I mentioned in the first video this is assuming you you're starting with the
stock tune you may have changed some things uh but at least for this I would recommend going back to something safe
and predictable and working your way up from there if you've altered the shift
scheduling like when it shifts for wide open throttle or part throttle you can
keep that and most likely you can keep your torque converter settings as well we're going to cover both of those in a
future video but at least for anything doing with the pressures and timing and adaptives we're going to start from
scratch on this one before we get into it though I kind of I dig the history of things
History
um maybe I'm just a little bit nerdy um but I get a kick out of those old Forum posts back when the Gen 4 stuff
was brand new and there just wasn't a whole lot of information in general for the transmission but also the number of
tables available in HP tuners was a lot less and so when you have a lot less tables
that all those guys were really scrutinizing well what does this one do and how does it work and so one of the
early on tables they had was this inertia Factor profile now when you click on it
you can see Zero or two through nine um pretty basic numbers right and then
when you read uh uh let's go back over here to the description um this calibration of the shift feel
but the data range is 16 0 through 16 that's five bits of data and they're
like well I must be leaving something on the table I'm only at 9 out of 16 but
man this thing goes to 16 let's pump it up right and so maybe they did that and they interpolated the entire section and
now we should be really hitting these hard firm crisp shifts but in the end
they found that that actually didn't happen and so if you go to the shift
timing and you look at the up shift here and
you look at this transition time you can see this is what it's referencing the the
factory only built in one through nine and one is zero but everything else at
least Factory tune on my car is a quarter of a second so changing this to
16 or doing anything and here really kind of does nothing now these other tables if you look at the final normal
um it does have a few other things in here but this isn't you know groundbreaking type stuff yes you can if
you wanted to you can click in here and we could say well I want it to go to 16 and I want to interpolate it all the way
down but you haven't really gained anything by doing this I mean you could change
these numbers but it's really not going to map or change much at all so if
you've done it and I don't think anybody really messes with this stuff but I just thought I'd point it out that it is
there and just kind of just something to think about all right so let's move on to the next thing
Shift Pattern Profiles
okay so the next thing uh let's talk about shift pattern profiles so to get
to that we're going to go to shift pressures General and you know your car may be
different and some of these aren't even valid like you know my car doesn't have four-wheel drive so some of these are
used and not used it just sort of depends uh if you go into the scanner and you add the PID you can see as you
go through drive to sport mode tap up tap down or tow haul mode uh trailer
mode whatever you're gonna see what pattern is in here for me I want consistency I want my transmission
always on kill but I don't want to have different profiles I always wanted to be
consistent and reliable no matter the situation so if I toggle it back over here you're going to see all of mine are
set to pattern X so that's the only thing I want to tune I'm not saying you have to do it my way if you do want to
set up some different profiles certainly you can't but just be cognizant that that is there
the other thing is to shift pattern mode or the pressure pattern mode and there's
you know normal or special in here and by the way this is X Y and Z so you
potentially have three different profiles you can do and you'll see where these play out later in the tune but
again I want consistency I always want it on kill and predictable so when I flip this back over to mine I'm just
dealing with normal there's no real difference between normal and special other than you know it's profile one
profile two you can set it up however you want to right so but for ease of me
not having all kinds of different spaghetti settings here and there I just set it this way to make my own personal
life a little bit easier dealing with this stuff okay now let's talk about the most
Shift Timing
important thing when dealing with this transmission and how it shifts at least
it's the most important thing in my opinion because this kind of dictates everything everything is bowing down to
this master of shift timing so when we go to shift timing and we have up shift
here you can see these colors are changed just because I I change this to
to whatever 16 but ignore that for now this is where we're looking at here and
you can see I've only changed gears one through four I'm not really worried about you know
shifting into fifth gear or sixth gear you know 130 miles an hour and Beyond
um I really don't drive that fast I mean at the drag strip my car is winding out
at the top of fourth gear and it shifts into fifth gear after I cross the finish line so I'm not concerned at all uh you
know for regular Street driving and stuff I fear more damage coming from altering this stuff for the higher gears
it's just not needed all right so when we look at this this represents the stock shift timing here
um this section is your wide open throttle and this is where I'm going to suggest that you need to change this
everything that I've read says an acceptable fast speed that's safe for
the 6l80e in stock form is 0.2 seconds and that's what I have
a factory sealed 120 000 miles on this thing it hums along just fine there are
no issues with this at all um so I want to play it safe I'm not trying to rebuild the transmit I can't
wait for the day when it finally does puke and then I can build it up but I'm not trying to spend that money uh faster
than I need to so this is kind of the base where you're going to work from and again this is part of your trial and
error you can copy my the way I do it if you want to um I would suggest not to I would
suggest working it up on you know with your car you know my head's in cam combo
my exhaust my rear end ratio my torque converter my driving style the weight of
the car all of that is going to come into play here so do this for years you
know kind of work this out so 0.2 seconds and then as we look down here we can see it kind of raises up and I don't
really like that so I kind of want to make it a flat line across here
um so we could maybe do something like this and interpolate it across
and get a flat line now these other ones also we probably need to adjust as well
I'll kind of show you the the final shape that I settled on here so you can see this is our our high
speed or our wide open throttle down here and then these shift areas up here
this is going to be your normal like City driving right like I kind of generally baby my car when I'm not
racing and so this area right here represents the I'm in town I'm not
trying to be loud maybe I'm in a neighborhood maybe I'm downtown and it's echoing in buildings I'm trying to be a
responsible hot rodder and not turn people off or whatever and you know I just don't want to beat up my car unless
I have to so I want it to Glide off the line and have nice quick smooth shifts so I've dropped the shift timing up here
and then as the RPMs wind out I increase the shift time for this area up here
this is going to be like you know if maybe you've floored it and you've
accelerated really fast and it hasn't up shifted but then you let off the throttle and you're kind of coasting
this is what this shift is for and I've more or less left it stock now the important thing here is you want
fast shifts but they should be smooth you should not get that rowboat effect
um where during this shift it takes a long time and you kind of lurch forward a little bit and then when the clutch
drops it pushes you back in the seat you do not want that rocking motion if
that's if you're getting that that's a pretty good sign that you need to lower your shift time we don't want that hard
drop of the clutch right it should be smooth this isn't the 80s we're not dealing with the shift kit that's
barking the tires we have a modern computer controlled transmission that's capable of so much we just kind of have
to help it along so again these shift times are going to dictate everything
else that happens in the transmission all these other settings are going to try to make these shift times a reality
so alter the shift times get them to where you want where you don't have that rowboat effect
the only other thing and remember I said less is more this is
all I've changed these three now I did change special but as you saw back in that other setting I
wasn't even using special I'm all in the normal section right here
um the only other thing and maybe we can go back here
so stock remember this was nine right I changed it to 16 earlier but really this would
be two through nine on the factory form this is just uh 25 you notice it is in
percent and if you read this we go over here it's saying percent of
desired shift time to transition from initial turbine acceleration to maximum turbine acceleration well the turbine is
the part of the torque converter that's connected to the input shaft of the transmission so whatever our shift time
is if we go back over to here
so a wide open throttle if we have 0.2 seconds for this shift a quarter of that
is going to be what half a second so in this case
um is saying a half a second of your shift time at wide open throttle we're going
to dedicate to getting that turbine to the right speed or acceleration so the only thing I've changed is I've cut it
down to 20 percent because again a wide open throttle we have more RPMs and more
torque that turbine should be able to spin up or spin down a lot faster to
make that a reality uh so one other thing I forgot to
The NoNo Zone
mention regarding the shift timing is for all of the tuning that we're doing we're only dealing with the up shift
anything related to downshift we are going to leave Factory form there's really no benefits or gains to be had by
having some super quick firm downshift that just represents too much of a risk
that we don't need and for for what there is no benefit so leave the downshift stuff alone and only focus on
the up shift this is the No-No Zone
now I said the shift timing is the most important thing and we really didn't spend a whole lot of time on that this
will be a little bit of trial and error to to bump these things around basically
you're going to want to make them um as long as possible but still smooth
so kind of maybe start out on the high side of things so if we flip back over to stock come here and then you know
you're going to slowly start working your way down to get to something that you can live with and that that feels
all right to you um and then the pressures are going to support it and this is where I feel like
a lot of people get upside down on this and what I mean by upside down is you
hear the complaint so many times I flashed a transmission it rained great
for a while but the adapters made the shifts go soft well
if your adaptives are kicking in and making your shift soft then that's a
symptom that you are upside down on your shift timing and your shift pressures
the pressures support the time so if you don't have an aggressive time meaning
these numbers are too high well then guess what happened if you command a high amount of pressure it's
going to say whoa whoa I was able to hit this shift time easily
um maybe I can knock the pressure down a little bit let me so if we're shifting
at 200 kPa well maybe I can knock it down to 175 kPa oh you know what I still
hit my shift time let me knock it down to 160 kPa and let's see if I can still
hit the shift time so it's going to keep lowering and lowering the pressure as
long as it's hitting the shift time because this is what you ask for this is what you're after you're not after a
hard shift you are after a quick shift so again the adapters are there to lower
their pressure only use the minimum amount of pressure needed to support the shift without causing excess pressure or
wear on any of the parts so if the adapters are going soft either
you need to lower the pressure or you need to decrease these shift times
so if you if you start out on the opposite which is I have a very aggressive shift time and not a lot of
pressure well the first time you shift the transmission is going to say wait a second
he commanded 200 kPa and I still didn't hit that shift time so I guess I need to
increase pressure maybe I should go up to 225 kPa to hit that Target
so if you undershoot the pressure the adapters will adapt up and that will prevent things from going soft on you so
let's talk about the pressures here there are quite a few settings and they
Pressure Settings
might be a little bit uh daunting so we're going to go through this and then I have a PowerPoint at the end that
I'm going to kind of tie how all of these pressures trickle down from Upstream to Downstream
the first thing we have is this maximum pressure so Factory on my car was 758
kPa and this kind of represents um the maximum allowable so you see a
lot of times in these in this tune in the computer that you have a lot of
settings maybe some math or some calculations uh operate in the background but then you have a table
that says hey no matter what happens whatever calculations go through in adders and modifiers and multipliers at
the end of the day you cannot exceed this value maybe you can't go higher or you can't go lower and in this case it's
saying no matter what happens you're not going higher than 758 kPa so for my tune
I just bumped it up a little bit to 900 that's not really a big change percentage-wise
and I don't even know what the maximum is I mean you know you can command
almost 4 100 kPa I don't think the stock transmission pump is ever going to hit
that what is the max I have no clue if you know let me know but 900 is nice and
safe now when we get to the PowerPoint that I'll show you at the end of this uh
video we're going to talk about these things right here but for now we're just going to kind of ignore them so then
that takes us to this line pressure and you can see uh from the factory
the pressure actually drops off for some reason the more RPMs that you've built and I'm I'm not sure why that is the
case I would think let's take a look I'm going to go off script let's look at
this actually let's go back because I kind of messed with that one let's look at this stock one here
yeah so this makes sense then I guess in the context of this look at these shift times
for their wide open region so at maximum torque as RPMs climb it's
commanding a slower shift time interesting to see as RPMs raise
pressure drops off again pressure supports the shift time so if we're
commanding a slower shift time then guess what we need less pressure to hit that
but this line pressure does not actually feed the direct shifting of what we're going
to support So for that we need to take a look at something else but before we go
um we do need to since this Max Pressure here is acting as a clamp onto here
you can see I've pumped mine up to 900 kPa and so when we flip back over to
mine guess what this is no longer like if I left this at 758 this is going to put a halt to the
fun here and it's going to say you can't I'm sorry I'm not going to allow you to hit 900 kPa
um so make sure that these match make sure that they agree
um and that these things are simpatico okay so let's talk about the next thing
that's Downstream and also super important um with all of these pressures
Base Shift Pressure
okay so the next place that we have to look at is the base shift pressure so if
we're on shift pressures we're going to pop over to up shift and now we can start seeing some of this pattern
business again I'm only dealing with pattern X I've ignored these who cares I
don't use them so if we look at these we can see some other interesting things
in here so if we go back to shift pressures General now this is interesting to me because
stock form it says your max pressure is 758 but when we look in here where the
heck did these come from and we look at max line pressure um you know 726 well I mean I guess
reverse is a little bit higher at 850 for some reason but our forward gears I
mean this is our one two up shift right here 1568 where the heck did that come from
and we'll touch on this when I get to that PowerPoint in a little bit but I believe it's coming from this Max
Pressure B B for base shift pressure and so if we
look at that it's it's up to 1900 kPa and if we read the description
it says in some cases this value may be calibrated as the actual line pressure
after the regulator gain has been applied so it is my assumption that this
regulator gain is applied sometimes depending on the running condition
um I don't have any other tables at least in my OS or that I've seen that we can look into this regulator gain or set
anything related to that so this I've left alone the only thing that
I've changed from stock is just this off the line stuff you know floating between stop lights or stop signs downtown or
whatever I just kind of want a little bit better shift to occur at the low RPMs I'm not doing anything for the high
high torque high speed wide open type shifting and this made and I'm not going
crazy if you look up here at this line 704 and 800 I've just carried that down
to these other ones so I'm not really asking it to do anything beyond stock
that this stock GM Engineers have said this is safe and allowable
and so if we look in here well I have done this for Gears one through five
again I left six alone again no need really to mess with that when you're shifting you know at a hundred and I
don't know 50 miles an hour or something like that it's not like I go that fast anyway
um so uh this is the base shift pressure um and then from there and by the way
before we move on again downshift is the No-No zone no reason to touch any of
this stuff at this time okay so now let's go the next thing
Adaptive Volumes
that's further Downstream and that is the Adaptive section now
this is the part where it gives people so much grief now before we get to the pressure we're going to talk about these
volumes here so you can see we have a minimum volume and a maximum volume in this oncoming
volume preset these volumes are directly related to
the physical and mechanical parts that are in the transmission this has to do
with timing of how how long the computer expects it to fill a clutch solenoid
before it activates I don't know if this is milliliters or if this is some
meaningless number it's probably milliliters or cubic centimeters or something like that do not change these if you're if your
transmission is Factory stock sealed hasn't been rebuilt or even if it has been rebuilt with Factory Parts
leave these alone if you have an aftermarket build us like
with thicker clutch plates in there uh friction plates or the the metal plates then you do need to change these all
right but if if it's otherwise stock leave them alone and the thing that causes everybody grief is this 2-3 right
it's always some wonky number why are all of these two hundreds but why and this one is 40. clearly this is a typo
but it is not leave this alone yours may not be 40 maybe it's 50 or 60 but leave
it stock this all has to do with the timing during the shift the transmission
is going to pre-fill the oncoming clutch with fluid and it needs to know about
how much fluid is going to go in there before it can start thinking about activating that clutch this goes into
that timing this is one thing that plays into the Adaptive so leave these alone if you do have an
aftermarket build get these numbers from your Builder if you go to a reputable shop ask them what to put in here they
are going to tell you the next area is this oncoming pressure preset oh and one more thing as the
clutch plates wear and they get thinner and thinner that friction material wears
off the adapters will take take over for that it's just like you know when we
have hydraulic lifters and those lifters take up lash in the valve line as you
know as there's valve train wear and stuff like that as heat and cooling come
into effect and the length of the push rod changes or whatever um that that hydraulic roller takes up
that lash well these these volumes also adjust as those clutch plates wear so no
need to change these let the computer handle this it knows what it's doing I promise you
all right the next area this oncoming pressure preset these are the things controlled by the Adaptive pressure so
everything else that we talked about in this General uh now I've lost it shift pressures yeah these pressures here
these are clamps these are suggestions these are just regulated it's just kind of dumb pressure coming down the pipe
but it isn't really regulated or modified until we get into here and you
can see we have oncoming and we have off going and these SPS these are for this
special remember when we set up wherever it was
um oh man somewhere in here where you had the pattern X and you know you had special
and all that kind of stuff here it is these specials right here that's where it's coming from
Pressure
so uh and again you can only see less is more I've only changed one through four and that is it these other specials are
left over I should roll them back to stock but it's not critical so when we look at this these are pretty small
mundane little pressures comparatively of what we've been looking at with you
know 900 kPa and that 1568 number it's my understanding that these two and
maybe let's talk about these real quick before we get to that oncoming this is the gear you're shifting into so this is
saying one to two so this is the one to two up shift so oncoming is this uh
second gear clutch and it's saying hey we need to figure out how much to pre-fill it all right now it's filled
now we need to determine how much pressure to apply and so this is our
guide for the pressure and this is a starting point the adapters are going to move these
things up and down to adjust them to hit your target shift time off going this is for the one two shift
this is for the clutch on gear one so basically we're going to disengage
the first gear clutch and then we are going to engage this other clutch the
more pressure we apply to these the faster they move and the faster they move the faster we can get the shift
done so the next thing we need to discuss here when we look at this are these
numbers 0 1 and 2 and we'll dig into that in a second but at least no for now zero is going to be very low torque
coming from the engine one is going to be you know your mid-level torque and then two is going to be high level
torque so in other words how much pressure do we need to use to move these clutches is
going to be based off of how much torque the engine is making more torque we're going to use more
pressure so if you get into a situation where you
kind of get like a shift flare and by flare I mean the transmission shifts the
RPMs kind of jump up on the engine but you don't shift yet you're waiting waiting and then boom the clutch engages
and it kind of throws you back into the seat sometimes that can be caused by not
enough pressure here so if it's continuing to do that in other words you
flash the tune and you've driven it for a week or a few weeks and it's just not getting any better well the adapters are
at that point most likely done adapting you need to move that shift time back down and and start there the other cause
that could be the case is both of these pressures are coming from that base
shift pressure so in other words so I'm saying these are lower right so
these are splitting off again my understanding of the physical architecture of this we have this much
pressure on tap and this pressure feeds both of these clutches so you know one
engages and one disengages we're kind of splitting the difference right here
so we kind of need a little bit higher here to maintain this so if you're like well I I don't want to
adjust the the shift time maybe I feel like it's too aggressive you need to do your due diligence here on this
investigation and that is make sure that this has enough pressure to support this
again mine is stock the only thing I've changed is these numbers so from there we need to go back upstream and now we
need to start looking at this max line pressure does this pressure support this
table which then supports these tables so if we flip this over to mine you can see well even though this says 900 we do
have these other pressures over here max pressure and Max clutch so this MAX Pressure B of B for the base shift
pressure should support this and Max clutch pressure
this is going to be in the case where the regulator is applied to support
these guys and maybe it's this one um again I'm a little fuzzy on some of
this stuff I'm still piecing it all together but I think I have a fairly good understanding so this says clutch
so I'm pretty sure if this is supporting this in terms of the regulator either way you need to track back upstream and
make sure you have enough pressure on tap to allow these clutches to work if
you've looked at it and you're sure that it's good to go then you need to start investigating about lowering that shift
time so when we look at this you can see these are pretty low pressures this is
Factory on mine I've just bumped them up a little bit and this is the one two shift and at the end of this when we get
to the conclusion I'll show you my oncoming pressures here no big secret they're not increased a lot just
increased enough and this is adaptive so it doesn't really matter what I put them
at the transmission should adapt up and down as needed to hit that shift time
all I'm doing by increasing this pressure is giving it a better starting point so
it has to make less jumps in its learning whether that's up or down
now let's dig a little bit more into this zero one and two business okay so
Discrete Shift Torque
let's talk a little bit more about the zero one and two numbers here where do those come from
so if you go into shift pressures in general you're going to see this discrete shift torque mode now discrete
shift torque mode is different but I'm going to just show you this real quickly here
you can see we have these buttons so we have a low mid threshold and we have a high mid threshold and then you can also
see these low medium and highs down here now it's my understanding
that these tables were not using discrete shift well in this case perhaps maybe we
are if we look at this um and we'll dig into that in a second but you need to see this breakdown of
low medium and high so it's basically saying for the Zero Entry our threshold
may be 140 foot pounds but you can also look over here we can kind of get an
idea of the layout or breakdown so zero torque or negative torque and then 221
foot pounds and then 443 foot pounds so there may be other break points in here
that we cannot see um how these values are so I can't tell you
exactly but when we look at the discrete torque we can see that there is some type of delineation of a breakdown of
what's low medium and high so what is discrete shift torque
so let me kind of move these guys out of the way here and let's take a look so this this discrete shift torqued we
have this enable thing right here so this is just on or off one is enabled
and zero is disabled and so all this is saying is if you recall when we were
looking at the shift pressures uh not this one and the Adaptive section
here uh engine torque is kind of saying
prevailing like this is the torque is going to tell us how much pressure we need to use but in some circumstances
like that one two shift it's you know it changes rapidly it's
such a low gear that RPMs climb it's maybe kind of fluctuating a lot it's not
really reliable so rather than taking an instantaneous torque reading or
estimation we'll say listen for ease of the transmission learning for their adaptives and all this crazy
stuff let's just cut through the static and the noise and let's just be vague
and general here so for everywhere that it's set to one that's going to say well
all right if I am um below 140 foot pounds we're we are in
the low Zone but if I'm above 140 and Below 273 I'm in the middle Zone and
then if I'm above 273 then I'm in the high zone so for those instances it's
going to say okay well we can look here low medium and high this is kind of how our break points are going to work so
rather than interpolating the current torque and to determine the
pressure to use it's just going to say ah just let's round up and round down and be done with it and not sweat the
details but everywhere else where it's turned off where it's zeros it's going to say well let's take our time on this
let's let's estimate our current torque and let's interpolate as needed and then
you know we'll translate that over into how much pressure that we need to use so
a while back um I did set mine I can't remember the exact scenario it's been a while I
turned it off for the 2-3 shift um I don't know that I really noticed
any difference my guess is I can probably re-enable it at this point and
not notice a single lick of difference but it is there so if you ever feel like
something's acting goofy and you want to experiment you can certainly do that but just know anything
that you enable over here you like if we wanted to enable the one three up shift we'll look over here it's set to zero so
we probably want to raise that because otherwise it's going to say oh for the two one one three shift we will just
automatically assume zero torque or we'll round it down right so but we
don't necessarily want to do that right we probably want to put it at maybe 150 or something I don't know and then you
do that for all the patterns that you want to have that and so and then we probably need to do the same thing up
here what what's our cut off for the high area well maybe we just do 250 or
something like that or 225 whatever and so you can play with these um to enable it to force it a more
strict regimen of rounding up or rounding down to determine the pressure and that should make it a little bit
more stable but maybe not but that is definitely something uh that you can experiment with
um I just don't know for sure for sure these for all of these other ones that
aren't using discrete torque how it's determining what is zero one and two
what is the cutoff for those torque areas that I do not know
Shift Pressure
all right so let's break this down um and some chronological order of all
the things that happen before during and after the shift and then let's talk
about kind of how the pressure is all linked together and how it kind of goes Downstream so preparing for the shift we
have the ambient line pressure just in general uh being capped and maintained
by that one Max Pressure table and there's the number for that and then we
have the base pressures or the base shift pressure table and so that's kind of determined by the RPM and gear and
then it also has its other caps here so when the shift is commanded
um it says all right and by the way the shift is commanded part throttle it uses the accelerator position and vehicle
speed wide open throttle uses RPM and speed but either way whatever happens a
shift is commanded so at that point torque management kicks in and we're going to dig into torque Management in a
future video in this series but for now we're just going to say we know torque needs to be reduced for this
transmission to shift safely so after that the oncoming clutch starts
to fill with transmission fluid and we talked about this volume so the transmission kind of has a general idea
how much pressure do I have behind it and how big of a volume do I have to fill so it's going to fill that
and then if there if you if your torque converter is locked up it's going to come unlocked there is an option in the
torque converter setting to unlock it or keep it locked during the shift but assuming it is locked at the moment and
you command it to unlocked it will unlock uh off coming or off-going pressure is implied applied to disengage
the clutch and then again you know we still have the zero one two thresholds we just talked about
uh versus you know if it's discrete or not and so on and so forth
and then the oncoming clutch is applied again it's going to look at well how much pressure do I need which is going
to be determined by the engine torque initially but over time the adaptives are going to say
um well I know based off of the current torque exactly how much pressure to apply
Adaptives
um and then after the shift occurs torque management is removed in other words you
go back to normal torque if needed for criteria for the torque converter by the
way we will talk about the torque converter in another video here in this series as well if the conditions are met
to lock it up it's going to lock up and then after it's all said and done the transmission is going to sit back and
have a little retrospective and say well did I hit my shift time or not yes or no
and it will increase or decrease the adaptives as needed
so as you can see it's all about that shift time so be aggressive on your
shift time and not as aggressive on the pressure and you are going to hit that
uh now let's see this is my oncoming and off-going pressures and these are just
for the ones I've changed gears one through four we have the oncoming ones on the left and off going on the right
so stock pressure versus what I have and this is the percent change so HP tuner
style of just multiplying you know 1.25 or whatever but you can see the delta in
here and in general I would say if as you're messing with the ongoing and
off-going pressures start out small this isn't something that you want to make big changes in terms of just raw kPa so
anything you know 510 kPa at a time maybe up to 40 at a time but this should
be a small increment kind of thing again the adapters are going to do most of the work for you you just want to give the
adaptives a good foothold to move forward on okay so putting everything together as
Pressures
far as the pressures how they're regulated and flow Downstream simple block diagram we have the
transmission pump driven off the input shaft of the transmission when it supplies pressure defined by the
maximum line pressure and then we have the max line pressure versus RPM versus
gear and then from there we have a decision point and again this is my understanding
based off of the description in HP tuners about that regulator gain being
applied it's not exactly like any of this stuff is clearly documented I don't think GM
ever really intended for anybody to do what we're doing so I may be wrong on this and if you
know different or have other information believe me I'm all ears please let me know I'm I'm a student of learning
so depending on what path we take this pressure then will either feed into this
base shift pressure or if regulator gain offset is applied it goes into this area
to modify this pressure here and then from there we can either go
straight to the clutches ongoing and off coming clutch to control those or again
depending if that regulator gain is supplied we go to that Max clutch pressure table
after it's all said and done the adaptives are just working here at this level so everything else that's not this
is just a simple dumb cap right like we specified how many kPa to use and no
more than that and then so the adapters really are only controlling a very small part here
for the volume and that pressure on those clutches so if we put together the individual
components within HP tuners you can see the max pressure here is controlling the
this table sometimes we're going to have the regulator gain applied here and then
again as we go down these are our clutches right we may have that regulator again applied here or there
again this is my understanding I may be incorrect on this love to hear any
information you have about anything different
Flashing the Tune
okay to flash the tune once you've worked everything up it's pretty simple you probably know where this is going
we're going to click the right vehicle option I like to only flash one thing at a time
whether it's the ECU or trans I'm also going to disable the fuel pump control module here and so we're just going to
do right calibration uh avoid right and tire unless you have a specific reason
to do that same thing goes whenever you flash the ECM typically right
calibration is what you're going to be doing 99 of the time at this point I'm not going to flash it
but you would just hit the right option and on my car it takes I think 45 seconds or so once it's connected and
actually uploading the tune so I'm going to hit cancel here now after the tune is flashed I would
suggest that you need to turn the car off and take the key out close the door
and let it sit for a second to give it a second to reset and then go back in and start it from
scratch at this point you need to go into the scanner and we got to reset the vehicle
at adapt adapters word I'm hunting for so you're just going to connect to the
vehicle then you're going to click on this power icon here vehicle controls and special functions
and you're going to go to the transmission and in here we have a trans adapter reset and trans adapt preset
you're going to want to hit both of those if you have a stall converter you cannot
do a fast adapt reset or I should say a fast learn either of these avoid doing
it's not going to really help in order to make that work you have to
add the PID for the fast learn status inside of the scanner
start the car start scanning come in here to vehicle controls and do the fast adapt and then the PID I don't have it
added but it would show up over here and in the value section it's going to tell you okay idle it all right hit the
throttle and rev it up to however many RPMs are shipped into a certain gear and if you don't follow those instructions
exactly it will fail a lot of cars even on the factory transmission engine and
torque converter will still fail but essentially it's really dependent on
having the factory torque converter if you have a high stall the computer the
transmission is trying to factor in the slippage rate of the stall converter itself and it's
cycling through the oncoming and off-going clutches to figure out how much time and pressure is needed to hit
that shift time as soon as you have a high stall converter it is unable to calculate and regulate any of that stuff
so don't do the fast stuff really you're going to have to do the normal adapt reset and preset and just drive around
now the other thing is when you hit these buttons and I'm not going to do it because I don't want to reset my adaptives it may not look like anything
is happening but if you look down at your mvpi I have an MVP mvpi2 so two or
three I've never used the original but you should see the light turn from I think it's blue or green and it'll flash
that um like purple colors like the blue and the red together and when you so when you
click it watch that that light and you'll see that in fact data is being sent over the can bus to the computer it
kind of stinks there's no feedback when you click these so you just look at that light that'll tell you everything you
know so once you do that um turn the car off you know open the door close the door cycle the ignition
all that kind of stuff and then drive around and then just go easy on it for the first few miles let it hit those
shifts and let those adaptives start taking over and and getting the pressure to where it needs to be so don't don't
go Full Throttle right away but vary the throttle and RPMs use tap up tap down to
uh you know delay the shift into a higher RPM give give the transmission some data to work with so it can figure
that stuff out all right so that wraps up this video
Recap
um but I did want to do a quick recap here we covered a ton of material but I just want to hone in on the two major
important things we really did not change all that much remember less is
more I was totally Blown Away um at how well the transmission shifts
with just a very few changes I used to think to make this thing shift required
all kinds of magic a million little settings and Secret Sauce down to the decimal places just trying to eek every
little bit out but it truly it's you don't need to do that look at this all I
did uh if we ignore the special I changed the timing the shift times on one through four I just pumped this up
from 0.25 to 20 percent here and then in pressures
um I just whoops we were there I just pumped that up to 900 pumped up this clutch pressure
here to 900 in these last two rows and then in the Adaptive section I just
increase the oncoming and off going pressures for one through four and that's basically it it's unbelievable
how much that makes a difference in the way this transmission shifts and feels now this is like kind of half of the
equation so to speak in terms of shift feel and crispness in in quickness we
still have yet to talk about virtual torque and uh in general torque management as well so we're gonna get to
that I promise but this is the Lion's Share of what you need to know and when
you look back at this and you think like man this is actually pretty safe I have not changed a whole lot of stuff I'm not
increasing pressure through the roof this you should feel totally safe with
this tune so I hope you learned something today and got something out of this and hope you enjoyed the ride and I
hope you stick around for the rest of the videos because we have so much more to cover you have any questions comments
whatever I'm fired up in the chat I'd love to hear from you anyway Happy tune in talk to you next time

collection of pixels here to make my car faster and hopefully make your car faster and better as well
today we're going to be talking about torque management as it relates to shifting so the first place we're going
to jump into is the transmission tab over here and under the torque management tab
General now at this point the only thing I would suggest doing is just changing this
speed control terminate most likely the factory has it set to torque ramp we
want it set to immediate and all that's doing is causing the ignition timing to
drop out and drop back in like a light switch just on and off whereas torque
ramp is going to be more like a rheostat when you're adjusting the lights in your house and you're going to turn it down
and then you're gonna rotate it to turn it back up it's slow relatively slow but
we just want an on off light switch boom immediate so from there we need to go to this up
shift tab I would recommend leaving this all completely Factory whatever you have for torque Factor what should all be one
and these adders just leave that as Factory as well same thing for the cold
multiplier and the adder modifier just leave those things alone now this is how it was Factory on my car which is a 2014
Chevy SS sedan AKA holding Commodore shout out to all the crazy Aussies down
there but if we were to actually let's do this let's open a compare I have a
2007 Corvette and you can see they actually do have some numbers in
here that are different than mine even and down here in the outer modifier as
well so oh the break points are just different but they're still all zeros uh
so no big deal but you can see there are some differences so whatever you have don't don't make it
like mine just leave it stock let me go back to my compare real quick
all right now the other thing I'm going to call out is you notice we have an up shift Tab and there is no downshift tab
so I would imagine there is a downshift section to the ECM TCM that we cannot
see that's not exposed through HP tuners and I'm going to go ahead and guess that all of these hidden values are set to
one and we just can't change them so if you come in here and you start setting these to 0.5 or whatever value you want
to now all of a sudden going back to kind of at the beginning when I said I
always want my transmission to be predictable and no surprises so now we
have the up shift is going to pull out half the torque reduction but downshift is going to be calling out a hundred
percent torque reduction probably not a huge deal or into the world but again we're we're setting up a scenario where
there's differences that we can and can't control and are hidden and we're guessing so I would encourage you to set
these all back to one as far as I know the factory always use once for all of these
all right so what does this one mean so one means a hundred percent zero means zero percent and then 0.5 means fifty
percent so where do what is that going to that's going to this engine tab over here on the spark tab Advance you have
two tables we have the base table and then we have this torque management table
now this one here minimum final spark as you can guess is acting like a cap or a
limit and so you can see in here it's saying uh this is the first table that
it looks at and it's commanding in some scenarios we want to go negative 25 degrees on the timing but this is saying
well you can't actually do that I'm going to limit you you can't go beyond negative 20. so all of these in fact is
not in practice going to be negative 25 they're going to be negative 20. so
that's one thing to remember so uh and as you can tell this is a factory tune and they're mismatched so I would
encourage you when you set Yours up um you can you should make a match right
and so if this was mine if this was what I was actually using I would change all of these negative 25s to 20. now you can
in some situations in an emergency maybe you're at the track and you just want to
change some things maybe you could say you know what I I'm just going to do zero for all of these things right here
to make them just make pull out less timing and then maybe come back and adjust these later so you can do that as
kind of a quick test here and there now when we look at this this is kind of a
goofy little graph and you have kind of a Sharp Peak a little shark fin up there
but don't know why it seems goofy to me but there are other things going on in
the factory tune so when you look at Flex Fuel now mine from the factory is zeroed out
um gas so you notice there are other things going on that may be adders and
multipliers especially when you get here to IAT ECT type stuff and even the
Catalyst stuff that may kind of either let me get back over to here
it may either knock this shark fin down up here or maybe it fills it back in but
it's not that it's changing this it's changing the starting point so what this does is when we look here into the high
octane table which is most likely where we are going to be driving cruising
around or whatever it's going to say all right so for instance we'll just use
this because it's easy it's right up here so it says not that we'd ever be running at zero RPMs but
if we had 28 degrees of timing or whatever it is and let's go back over
here to the minimum base and now this says negative 10. well
so a hundred percent torque reduction is going to say well you're going to start at 28 and you're going to go down to
negative 10. now if we were at 50 percent and I'm going to try to do math that's a 38
degree differential well 38 divided by 2 is going to be
18 18 that's 36 I don't know whatever uh
gosh darn it let's see I'm trying to think on the Fly while
people are listening and um 19 degrees yeah that makes sense okay so
if we had that table here in the trans this torque Factor here set to 0.5 then
it would say 19 degrees is halfway between 28 and negative 10.
but this is a global change and you know you can leave this and you can edit these things but this is a global change
for this one to shift meaning everything no matter where you are on this scale of
RPMs and air mass we're just going to cut it in half which is okay but
adjusting this minimum final spark really allows you to fine-tune things for drivability this whole area this
orange and yellow area this is like your cruising driving stuff you're off idle stuff parking lot sub this is the stuff
you're going to notice when you're driving wide open throttle you're probably not really going to feel a
whole lot of a difference right but so keep that in mind so when we look at this it's no surprise
that we're saying hey the stuff you're going to feel this torque reduction we want to we don't want to reduce as much
torque we want to keep timing in there so it feels like a nice crisp fast firm
shift wide open throttle this is more less about drivability but more about protecting the transmission
so you're ultimately going to have to come in here I'll show you how I have mine set up by the way
um if you look at this so you can see um here my drivability index basically
I'm at positive four degrees kind of sneaking down here to two degrees but
it's not really feasible you know after 4 000 degree or 4000 RPMs that I'm kind
of I'm not going to be shifting up in here this is probably more the you've accelerated down here and then you've
chopped the throttle and then your RPMs are sneaking back up here right and that
may be kind of a harsh shift so we don't necessarily want a lot of timing but
down here this is wide open so you can see I'm shifting that negative 10 degrees so ultimately you're going to
have to decide uh what you feel safe at in terms of preservation of the
transmission up here not a lot of RPMs not a lot of air mass there's not a lot
of torque so there's not a whole lot of worry about damaging the car so this is more about drivability and this is
protection so you come kind of come up with your own scheme I kind of started here looking at this
at the factory one and I said okay well the Factory's feeling safe about zero so
I think I just kind of interpolated all this over and shifted that to kind of fill in the
gaps and then I'm like well you know we can probably this is basically a zero so
let's make this zero and we'll keep going the trends here fill this in and
then this maybe we'll just interpolate all the way down 225 and then you know just if you can
leave these lines if you want or smooth them out but then start from there and say well you know what it's still kind
of a a weird shift going on up to 2000 RPM so maybe I'll just make this two
and so that's kind of how I arrived at that little stair step that you see in my chart here so you're going to need
to adjust it the larger the number okay more positive the less torque reduction
you'll have and the better it will shift now part of the reason why I have these
set so high is positive numbers is because I have kind of a large camshaft
and when the timing is too low it misfires and it coughs and sputters it
doesn't sound great but it's also a very slow recovery trying to get those RPMs
pumped back up from a low timing it's just a slow lazy recovery
so hopefully um your exhaust is set up in a way that you're able to hear those details of the
cam struggling as it tries to recover and you know keep in mind I mean I wouldn't get too too worried about it
because in the end um if you're misfiring and the engine's coughing and sputtering you're not
making any power at all so you're kind of going too far like you've gone past negative or zero foot pounds and you're
going into the negative foot pounds either way negative foot pounds is a big differential to what the car is
expecting and it may upset the apple cart so to speak so again we want that smooth quick shift and you're going to
notice it here in this low RPM range so you're going to need to set your scanner up
while you're driving and you're going to need to look at as you shift where this air mass is and now we go back to what
goes without saying you got to have the basics set up for your car for air mass so your math better be bang on and your
virtual volumetric efficiency better be bang on too now I do have another video how to tune ve virtual ve and math at
the same time using Dynamic air highly recommend you check it out because if your air mass isn't right then all this
is going to be wonky and not only is this controlling the the um the timing but it's also being
referenced in the torque the virtual torque and the the calculated torque which we will get to in a little bit so
a lot of things are dependent on your air mass being correct aside from you know your actual fuel injectors as well
okay so now let's dig in to uh this PowerPoint and kind of go
over some other finer details of this stuff too so I can explain it a little bit better
okay if you saw my last video which was the addendum to shift time and pressure you've already seen this slide before
for those that you haven't I would definitely recommend checking it out it's I wouldn't say it's required for
this video but definitely is good in general but just to recap uh so this
this 45 degree line is going to represent the ideal or perfect shift completely
neutral or maybe think about it as if you never shifted and you just kind of
continued on that same uh feel and you never shifted it just kept kind of going
this thick black line is going to represent the real world the car shifted
you're going to feel it and so this would be kind of what I would graphically represent as what a factory
shift feels like it's very safe very slow not very positive feeling just kind
of wishy-washy so when we break it down into time if the torque converter is locked it will
unlock and then we're going to apply torque management which is to say we are going to reduce the engine torque
which we'll discuss in depth today and then the oncoming clutch will fill adapters are being used the off-going
clutch will disengage adaptives are being used the turbine acceleration will
be characterized um and this is what the last video that addendum was talking about
and then the oncoming clutch will engage and adaptives are there all of those
four things are encapsulated that's like kind of internal to the transmission of
what's going on after that's done then torque management is removed which is to say the normal
torque is restored and that's external to the transmission as that's related to the engine and so that's what we're
talking about today and then optionally the torque converter will lock back up if conditions are met and it needs to do
that so this torque management here is a huge
impact of what your shift is going to feel like you can have the fastest shift
internal to the transmission but if the torque reduction isn't working together with that shift it's not going to feel
very good right this is really what you feel this torque management
so let's talk about I know we're talking about torque management today but while we're doing this wonky graph thing that
I've completely made up let's talk about Circle back to too much pressure so if you've commanded too much pressure
whether you've turned adaptives off which I would not recommend or the transmission has not had a chance to
adapt down this is kind of what it's going to feel like you're going to get that initial hey we gotta pull some
torque out we got to do the shift and then it's going to slam those clutches and it's going to be violent and you're
going to get this this oscillation this rocking back and forth just like if you botched a shift in a manual transmission
and you get that lurching and rocking and bouncing you you don't want that why haven't uh a state of the art automatic
transmission if it's going to shift like garbage now what about too long of a shift time
here we can see if it's going to take forever the car is going to slow down quite a bit and you're going to feel it
you're going to kind of rock forward a little bit and then the clutch is going to drop and then you're going to get
slammed back in your seat and you're going to get that that feel for a really slow one you're going to hear the RPMs
kind of start to flare up a little bit and we definitely don't want that
so what about no torque management so if you eliminate torque management which I
would recommend that you never do this is gonna what what it's gonna feel like and you're going to feel the normal
shift happen um and then with no torque management the engine's
still making full power but those clutches are going to engage and they're going to start to slip and then the
shaft differential between the input shaft of the engine and the input or the output shaft well I should say the
crankshaft of the engine and the input shaft of the transmission are mismatched but then they will slowly as the RPMs
bleed off from the crank and go to the transmission you're going to get that feel and I found a spot actually in my
tune I was looking at a a graph for um I was at the drag strip and I was
logging the trans uh transmission input shaft RPM turbine RPM same thing and the
the engine RPMs and you can kind of see this little blip here so we definitely don't want this to
happen either this is clutches slipping damaging and that's not good right because it's putting that friction
material in your trans fluid and it's sending it throughout the system but that slipping is also producing heat and
you know heat is kind of the enemy of the automatic transmission
so um we definitely don't want uh too much
torque management or too much torque reduction as I was saying before if you pull out too much timing it's really
that Cam that engine is going to start to cough and sputter and we don't want that easier it sounds like garbage but
aside from the transmission doing a fast shift if the engine is going to take forever to recover to get out of that
misfire then what's the point of having a fast shift you know so we want to
avoid that as well so the idea is a great shift will be
fast and smooth with minimal um impact to the feel of the car so
hitting this perfect line is probably not realistic um at least in a broad sense like you
could probably do it uh but it would take forever to dial that in for all RPMs all torque ranges
all gears that's going to be tough so you know close enough I hate to say
is what you need to aim for so balancing of torque reduction so up
here if we had no torque reduction right the clutches are going to slip as they're going to be unhappy but it's
going to feel great you're going to like the way the car drives maximum torque reduction the clutches will be happy but
you're not going to be happy with the way the car is driving and even and when I say
maximum torque reduction ideally this is going to be where the the crankshaft and the input shaft and the output shaft all
are doing the same RPM so it's a totally neutral feel to the clutches think about
the clutches so as they engage and disengage as soon as that happens is there a differential in shaft speed that
is going to be what the ideal perfect torque reduction is going to be your
goal is to kind of get into this safe Zone up here um so low RPMs drivability you know where I
was showing you before I had positive four degrees of timing um not a lot of torque reduction but
it's also not really needed because we're not making a lot of torque high RPMs uh wide open throttle you're gonna
have to pull that timing back a little bit more so this is uh what this looks like in
practice as I already showed you just for recap this is your idle area and kind of your cruising off idle gliding
through some stop signs in the neighborhood where you want that invisible seamless one two three shift
to kind of get you going and this is wide open throttle down here which I
have to negative 10 degrees so we can actually though think about well aside from controlling the timing
the timing is really just controlling the torque so we're we're basically indirectly controlling the torque so we
can actually start to map this out so over on the left I have the minimum final spark table
and then I have the virtual torque tables over here now as you go through this exercise and you don't have to do
this but I just want to show you where all of these things are if you're a dork like me with a lot of time on your hands
and you want to start mapping this out just be aware that the RPM break points are different and over here the air mass
is in grams but here when you have this set to air mass it is in milligrams so
you just move the decimal place so point two over here is the same thing as 200 over here no big deal but also keep
in mind there's Mass there's map and then you have the corresponding tables for E85 as well but this is going on air
mass not map so from there then we can look at the and find the equivalent so for
negative 10 here's my negative 10 table so I can say okay well at 6400 RPMs and
uh you know 800 right we can say okay here's the 800 and here's 6400 it's
saying you're shifting at 107 foot pounds so you can start making this map here
and now what about these Oddball ones like two well you can change this Min in
the Max and change the increment so when you really want to dial in you can change this increment to one and this 10
you can see it goes negative 10 0 positive 10 those are steps of 10. but if you wanted to see like two degrees
you could set the minimum to zero and the maximum to three or maximum to three and then put the
increment as one and then it will just show you one table for each one of those so you can look this stuff up the
decimals are going to be you're not going to be able to do so you're just going to have to round so I went through the exercise okay well
let's take that and now let's put that into a 3D graph and kind of see what this looks like
so here this Idle Zone you can see I'm kind of in here this flat area is going
to be zero so you can see and like I said with the cell break points
uh you know like my idol is set for 700 RPMs but I have a 400 and an 800 but
over here we go 550 to 750. so I tried to mentally interpolate just a little
bit and so you can see it's kind of a rough area here but in general it looks like it's shifting either a zero or you
know slightly negative here so pretty safe when I get on the gas and I start
cruising now we bump up into this area and then wide open throttle we drop down
up here this area I had no idea until I went through this exercise the negative
10 degrees with this much air mass is predicted by virtual torque to be so
high so I could probably and it's unreachable right but maybe for my own sanity I may drop this down quite a bit
after seeing this so that is how you would map that you
don't need to do this but I thought for the sake of of this video I would go
through that exercise and kind of show you we'll talk a little bit more about virtual torque anyway so
um anyway uh we'll move on all right so I've mentioned torque quite a bit but we haven't really talked too
much about how this relates to other areas of Shifting we touched on torque reduction and how that relates to shift
feel but there's also some other things that we need to talk about so back in
the transmission tab under shift pressures when we look at up shift we
can see up here this is interpolating based off of engine torque to determine
how much pressure you can see the kPa value these kPa values well how much
pressure do we throw at the transmission well that's going to be based on the prevailing torque and same thing for
downshift and even in adapters when we look at this oncoming pressure preset remember we have the zero and the one
and that kind of relates to the the general idea about this discrete shift
torque and we have certain break points depending where we're at and then that
puts us in the low medium or high range here but all this is dealing with engine
torque to determine how much pressure do we throw at the transmission for any any
situation now how does the computer know how much torque it's got on its hands at any
given moment well I believe and this is my understanding this may be somewhat flawed it may be spot on but I'm going
to show you what I've what I think is going on here in the scanner you can see
that there is a PID there's actually two for engine torque there's engine torque and there's delivered engine torque
um I think pretty much they should be the exact same thing one's probably SAE
in fact let's take a look while we're digging in here
so there is yeah and deliver torque and engine torque one may be SAE or not
um and let's look at this real quick we'll we'll go on a side tangent here
where is my torque value engine torque right here
let me spell it correctly
Okay so we have delivered torque and engine
torque and you notice they both have this this Arrow here so this is a polling Channel meaning the scanner is
going to request from the engine hey how much torque do you have and then it will reply back this barometric pressure you
notice it only has one Arrow that's a broadcast PID so that means basically
the computer is broadcasting out on the can bus Network hey anybody that wants
to know here's how much barometric pressure we have so I'm guessing one of these is SAE and the other one is not
all right let's go back to this log here oops the wrong one
all right so from my understanding this torque PID that we have over here is
essentially like steady state it's calculated and if you watched my video on dealing with Dynamic error
um uh like adjusting your math and your virtual volumetric efficiency at the
same time you'll know that the engine says Hey under steady state conditions I like the MAF sensor that mass airflow
sensor is amazing under transient conditions I cannot rely on the mass
airflow sensor and I need to go back to the virtual volumetric efficiency table to predict how much air is going in and
out of the engine so I believe this torque is the same way this is a calculated value and if we go
back in here into the engine side and we go to spark we have this Max torque
timing and this is and you notice down here if I go down here it says uh you know
torque timing theoretical Max advance that delivers torque blah blah blah we do not recommend adjusting this table
so I know some tuners do adjust it they have a steady state Dyno variable load so on and so forth they can adjust the
timing and they can find where that engine is making maximum torque so I
would imagine this comes into play for a steady state as well as probably a few other factors involved and then the
engine knows about how much torque it's making based off of the air mass however
during the shift everything goes crazy and we have a lot of transients going on but more importantly the engine needs to
know hey I need to drop down to 56 foot pounds of torque well how how do I
achieve that and that's where these virtual volumetric or virtual torque tables come into
now these are ruled by coefficients just like the virtual volumetric efficiency
so you can see we have a range from negative 10 to positive 40 and this is
here so if I don't want to see that maybe I just say you know what show me one through ten and show me increments
of two and so oh well it would help if I do this
correctly and we want increments of two so there we go we got 0 through 10 and
then an increments of two so this is you can't just set these to anything you want if you do you
you'll impact all of them as well because they're ruled by coefficients now I would say
the virtual torque table in general probably you shouldn't be messing with this if you have a mechanically stock
vehicle and you're just doing a tune only don't touch them if you're full
bolt-on you got the long tube headers the intake manifold cold air intake fancy spark plug wires and a bunch of
stickers still I would not touch this thing once you even if you get a baby cam
um probably you'd be fine leaving this alone but once you start getting into larger cams and certainly you get into
Power Adder type stuff you're gonna need to bump these up for me I'll show you
what I did right or wrong and judge me if you will um we'll just set this back to stock
or maybe not stock but how HP tuners renders this for you initially I went
through here and you know I said I think I bumped everything up uh 25 so I just
multiplied here and then I didn't do anything to the low one because I'm I'm cam only
so it's not going to make a lot of power down low it's really a high-end type cam
so then I just interpolate it down and then extrapolate and then calculate
and then I'm done this made a gigantic world of difference to me and I'll
explain in a second now you also need to do the same thing for the map sensor and
even if you don't have E85 like in my case when I first did this I didn't but
then I later added a flex sensor I went ahead and did this so if I because maybe
I started out you saw me multiply by 1.25 maybe I changed it down to reverted
it back to stock and then bumped it up 10 or maybe it ended up on 20 I can't
remember but either way I wanted to keep all these things in sync so if I ever did add an E85 sensor I wouldn't have to
remember wait did I multiply by 15 or 25 percent so it's just easier to do that
if you have DOD then obviously you're going to want to do the same thing as well so now right or wrong like this is
still just modeling about how much torque do we think we're making it's not the same thing
as this PID in the scanner so at that point now when we go in here to these these
transmission tables and it's looking at the pressures let me go back I lost
myself shift pressures up shift so here we can say oh I'm actually you know the
old virtual volumetric efficiency tables or sorry virtual torque tables said I
was making 111 foot pounds but since I've been modified I'm actually I think
anyway I'm making 221 I need to bump this pressure up so this will have a huge impact on the
transmission because it thinks more pressure is being created or more torque is being generated so it needs more
pressure as well so bump these up in small increments now a lot of people
will say um that this is a caution area and it can affect drivability and especially if
you go too high and they but they never say why like why
is it so bad to overshoot it um and it'll though I think sometimes they'll say it'll pull power like if you
if it thinks it's making too much power it'll it'll pull back power or power that it's not making but I think where
this is coming from is on the engine side so you go to the engine tab torque management and you can look at all of
these things now I've pretty much maxed them out or this is the factory tune but
all mine is set to the maximum over 6 000 foot pounds of torque so again
Factory you're limiting here it's not going to let you make more power but on
mine it's maxed out so if the virtual torque if we go back
if I raise the virtual torque and it's virtual torque says dude you're making 150 foot pounds
and whether I am or not then the engine is going to look at the virtual Torx
they will say well how much how much timing do I need to pull out to get down to 85 foot-pounds and so it's going to
reduce power which is something you don't want when you got uh you know you're racing a Mustang or some kind of
Snack Pack you want to beat them right and we don't want to have random timing pulled out or throttle being closed
because some of this this traction control stuff and all this limiting can be controlled by the ignition as well as
the throttle so we definitely don't want that to happen so all of these ones that
you see in green here these tables they're all maxed out brake
torque limit um you can see here factory 184 minus
six thousand so I can do a nice roasty Smoky burnout for all of these things
and so if I I flipped it over here and you can see all of these other ones are maxed out as well
um to make sure that I don't get random timing pull going on of course this has nothing to do with shifting in general
but you can see this is tying in engine torque management to Virtual torque so
just understand virtual torque does have larger impacts than just the shifting
that's going on in here um to further help you now if you notice
if we go back here to the virtual torque we have all of these tables air mass and
map and so you're going to need to go through if if you want to start dialing in your virtual torque
go in your scanner and you notice I have all of these set up the same way I've created these histograms for air mass
and map I need to create the E85 ones but I just haven't and so as you go
through here it's going to be pretty hard to get all of these cells filled in especially when we have these jumps from
negative 10 to 0 to positive 10. to alleviate that
and you can kind of see how I've set these up I just use that torque PID and I set up the columns in the rows the
same way as the virtual torque tables but in the filter area right here this is for negative 10 and if I if I just
put this equal to negative 10 chances of me getting exactly negative 10 is going
to be few and far between so in this case I've said well just show me if it's
between negative 8 and negative 12 show me that that's what I want to see
and so all of these like this one just for example because I think I had this as negative 2 to positive two I changed
it ahead of time if you want to be less selective you can widen that up in this case negative 5 to positive five but in
either way you're going to need to put in some ranges in here so you can get some data and you know if these are
close I wouldn't mess with them but otherwise you can get an idea so let's just let's just take a look while we're
here see how close mine is I have no idea it's been a while since I've looked at this so we're at positive 10 timing
and 56 and 800 milligrams so let's jump
in and see so we are at 10
and we always say 56 oh we were at 80.
so that looks pretty far off actually to me I probably need to redo this this is saying 261 right so 56 and 80. oh wait
I'm on map what a blunder oh you know what
I need to open mind to see my virtual torque
tables it may not be so bad after all let's find out okay so what did we say 56 and
800 so 364.
56 and 800. so yeah I'm pretty far off so I need to adjust these tables it's
been a while since I've Revisited them they look like they're reporting too high so that's something that I need to
do so you're gonna have to go through all of these tables and get an idea of
do these match what the virtual torque is and you're going to have to go through and adjust them as well
so that's how virtual torque plays into this and so then after the shift right it'll it'll jump out of the virtual
torque and then it will kind of go back to this steady state to work to do
whatever wherever it went this guy here then that'll kind of be its operating model as well
so anyway I hope this helps you guys um figure out some more shifting type stuff it's gonna it's gonna take some
time to go through um go through the engine spark base here
and uh you know just just figure out what works here in this drivability range and then use that virtual torque
table to figure out what's what's safe down here and you can bump it up you know add a little more torque over stock
stock is you know overly safe for wide open and this is my table again I am not
suggesting that you copy this and set it up exactly like I have it you need to
figure out what works on your vehicle I have no problem showing you this for reference but you're going to have to
dial it in and make it work on your car that's that's why it's called tuning you got to set it up for your Hardware
anyway thanks for watching and uh let me know what you think and we've got a few
more videos to knock out for the 6l80 but we'll get through it anyway have a
good one bye all right guys I almost forgot I found a table that I wanted to talk about and I
totally neglected to so I'm going to add this short add-on here at the end so we were talking about primarily
torque torque management is coming through um on the spark table on the engine side
you have base and then you have the cap this minimum final spark so we're just throwing these numbers out here and we
don't really know the actual torque yes we can reference virtual torque and get an idea hopefully if virtual torque is
accurate that'll work uh unless you have a steady state Dino blah blah blah who knows so we're just blindly throwing
this timing out here and hoping that it's right or good all right the
transmission side actually has this table here maximum shift torque which in
the factory settings on my car is maxed out and it's still maxed out it's unchanged but it's kind of interesting
this is like a cap or a safety net so if I wanted to say you know hey under no circumstances should I ever shift more
than 200 foot-pounds well if you recall from that PowerPoint where I did the exercise of mapping this out this Edge
over here came out to like 420 foot-pounds or something ridiculous so rather than adjusting the these
numbers down I could come in here and say well you know what let's just make sure it never shifts more than 200. I
think ideally what would be really cool is to get rid of this whole timing table
just this three-dimensional table and then replace it with these values because you can see we're only saying
well in general no matter what on the one two shift regardless of RPM or
whatever set it to 200 but what if instead of setting the timing we could
set all of these cells to Unique values for the torque that we want to be
commanded to shift obviously that would require virtual torque to be spot on but anyway I thought this table was cool and
I may start experimenting with it and throwing it in the tune to see how it impacts but and who knows maybe this is
a table that was created but never implemented and it's just kind of a dead appendix table and changing it won't do
anything I don't know um so I'm curious if you have seen this table used in a factory tune or you have
used it yourself successfully I would like to know chime in and let me know your experience with this table all
right enough of that back to your regularly scheduled program

this collection of pixels of mine I will share with you today today we're going
to be talking about shift scheduling in other words when does the 6l80e shift
this is actually broken down into two parts so we have the part throttle shift
over here and then we have the Full Throttle over here if we look at the up shift we can see
that it is controlled by two things we have the throttle position and then we have the miles per hour and this is
going to tell us when the shift is commanded Full Throttle we can take throttle out of the equation but we have
miles per hour and then we also have the RPMs that will command when the shift
will happen so we'll break these down and talk about both parts so as normal when I go through these
videos I have the OEM tune pulled up and then I'm comparing it against mine so
all of these green cells that you see those are ones that have edited or been
changed from stock and then if you followed along up to
this point you've know that I kind of always want to keep my transmission consistent I don't ever want to enter a
condition of oh my in sport mode or tap up tap down and it's doing something a
little bit differently everything's consistent at least till the torque converter and then we're going to talk
about that in the next video but otherwise all the gear shifting the pressures time I want to make it exactly
the same so I've basically set this normal up how I wanted it then I've copied it to A and
B I don't remember what I did with hot but apparently I've changed it in the past tap up tap Downs uh specialty thing
that we're going to talk about here at the end but let's let's knock out the normal part throttle shifts
so I've taken the Liberty of copying this stuff out the stock and mine and I've put it into this
spreadsheet so here's a tab for the OEM values and then my values and then I just graphed
them out to take a look at these things so on the left side we can see the OEM and there's a few things that right away
jump out to me that man this is this is questionable like why why is it set up
this way the first one is you can see we have overlapping downshift and upshift areas now when you think about this
um when you are driving and say our current envelope we're right
here which is you know our our mod the combination of our miles per hour and throttle pedal when you hit the gas
pedal to go faster it goes fast it's going to shoot over to the right your speed will come up a
little bit but by and large you're going to be kind of doing one of these things and so you're going to cross a few of
these boundaries when you have these overlaps this is like confusion
okay and so this is what I call crossing the streams and this is what you get and
what's a super common complaint of the 6l80e you know it wants to shift but it
doesn't know if it wants to shift it can't decide if it wants to shift sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't it just doesn't know what it wants to do
it's kind of wishy-washy well I found in one of my logs for my testing this exact
scenario and you can see this yellow line represents I'm in first gear it says hey let's go to SEC nope let's we
need to go back down to First oh wait hang on I was wrong we need to get back into second gear
so this is the kind of stuff that you want to avoid so when we look at this you can see that I've clearly separated
out these boundaries try to keep them you know a nice distance between them and certainly no overlapping
the other thing and this is just an OCD thing uh you can see if you squint
really hard this dotted line and by the way the dotted lines represent the downshift this dotted line goes down
and so you know probably I don't know maybe I'm the only one that
notices this but if we look at this we can see
initially a zero percent throttle it says downshift at 4.9 miles an hour but
they're on out it drops to 4.6 I mean granted it's 0.3 miles an hour but this
is just kind of some weird sloppy stuff that why is how does that stuff even creep into the factory tune we I mean I
expect better maybe not everybody has the same expectations at me but it's a
little bit off to me I think um and then the overdrive you can see we
still have some crossing of the streams at least on my car obviously your vehicle most likely will be different
from the factory calibration um but you know why are these shapes they just don't seem to really match up
and so I kind of more closely mirrored the shapes over here
um so the other thing that I'll talk about is the overall shape and the
starting points and ending points here so the left side I've basically kept the
factory whatever the minimum speed is for each gear that's something that I've kept even though I have kind of a Rowdy
cam um it still seems to do just fine so I left that
the ending part is where we're going to connect essentially and we're going to have continuity between part throttle
and wide open throttle stuff and we'll get to that in a second but we're going to need to do separate testing on that
but the metal part you see I kind of have these nice gentle swooping S curves and so for me if you've listened to the
Past videos I kind of talk about you know I I have two modes that I drive my car in one is
um I'm in town you know I'm trying to be quiet trying to be a good citizen it's a loud exhaust
it's got a big cam it's got a big stall getting off the line is a little bit of
a noisy affair right and I'm not trying to give hot Riders a bad name and sometimes I just want to drive and not
cause a big Ruckus and that's what these s-curves are so on the left side is a
really gentle you know the invisible one two three shifts get you going get you moving without a whole lot of ruckus but
then as soon as you start giving it throttle you can see that these kind of exponentially grow
and they get a lot more harder to command that up shift and so that's where you get the aggression and which
is the other side of my driving is I'm beating on this thing and I expect it to perform so to me this is a perfect blend
of both of those worlds and you can look over here on this particular shift this three four shift it's pretty much a
straight line and pretty much same thing for this uh was this two three shift as well and I kind of went down that route
of having more linear straight lines um and it just I didn't like it as much
so this is all also going to come into play as you dial this stuff in and
you're going to have to do this in combination with your torque management and shift timing to get what you like
but generally once you get get these speeds dialed in the way you want it you're going to leave them alone this
isn't something that you're going to spend a lot of time tweaking on but just get them right and you'll be good
um all right so now let's talk about the Full Throttle shifts so this is going to be
something that you're definitely going to be required to do some testing on so here's some of the testing that I did
from quite a while back now first of all after I rebuilt the
engine you know I pretty sure I can get away with say a
7200 RPM shift point but I wanted to be a little bit more conservative so I
decided 6900 RPM sounds pretty safe to me so and these graphs
you can see that I've set a reference line for 6 900 RPMs so this is my goal
I'm looking at here and I want basically this RPM to hit that dotted line every
single time and so it goes without saying at this point
you're going to have to have the rest of your tune dialed in your timing your fuel like you need a safe tune something
you can count on before you start beating on this thing at wide open throttle start optimizing your shift
points so get that taken care of and then decide on your shift point we'll talk
about Optimum shift points here in a few minutes but at this point you can see like this
shift right our 2 3 shift looks like man it's golden um the one two probably not the most
reliable data in here and you may have some of these issues on the street like you can see the RPM jumps right so there
was some there are some traction issues here which is why it it's acting goofy
and you may have those same issues on the street you're going to have to figure out you know work on the shifts
that you can then backtrack to the other shifts that need attention on my car trying to do a full throttle one two
shift is impossible on the street tires just spin it's crazy
once you get into the higher gears it's going to be a little bit easier so how does this work then
now this is going to be uh you're probably gonna have to do a few of these polls um just due to like you can even see
this we got some slipping right here we got this little jump in the RPMs
so either way you're gonna probably have to do this a few times to get this dialed
in just due to your converter slippage now that's that's assuming you have a
high stall converter so for that how do you do that so uh I
just use cross multiplication you can do the same thing it works pretty good but basically you're going to find a shift
point on your graph that didn't meet your requirements and so you're going to
do your testing or what you observed your miles per hour to be which in this case is 126 miles per hour and then at
what RPM did that shift occur 65 16 and all I did was I just if we go back to
this log I just kind of drag this until I'm trying to find the highest RPMs
and then once I find that I lock it here so 65 16 126 and I plug that in here and
I said okay well I actually want it to shift a 6900 RPMs so at this point
whether you call it cross multiplication or proportions or just you know ratios
whatever you can take 6 900 RPMs multiply by 126 and divided by 65 16 and
that gives us a new Target of 133 miles per hour and so again do the weight due to your
cam due to your converter due to your speed which is wind resistance due to your gearing all of these things are
going to take an impact or a factor that you're not just going to command whatever RPMs you want to shift at wide
open throttle so when we come into here to these wide open tables
and if we go down to fifth
and six now actually my car won't ever shift into six gear at wide open throttle
you notice I've maxed that out to 318 miles an hour now I have what is it y
rated speed rating on my tires 186 miles per hour but you know centrifugal force
blows tires apart there is no reason to be really doing wide open throttle
shifting even into fifth gear on public roads I I like going fast as the next
guy but seriously be safe out there I mean have some type of Common Sense
either way but you can see now all of these shifts are at different RPMs and
that's because we need a little bit of a different lead time so as you go through and you cross
multiply you can see 33 58.93 well what do I have
over here 33 58 93.
so for all of these wide open shifts as you go and cross multiply and you you iron these out you're going to have to
meet up your end points on your normal shift tables you know you're up shift fifth up shift
six like all of these items you're going to want to basically as we go down in here
this end point needs to match this is the part throttle table needs to match where the wide open
throttle begins you want that consistency and no hiccups then this is what you're going to need to have
so once you do that you should be good to go
so a lot of this may seem a little bit daunting uh but it's not that bad I
think you get in here and you practice a little bit you'll get the hang of it not a big deal
but if you're new to it and you want a little bit of help blue cat back in the day wrote this tool this trans tool it's
like bctrans.exe check the video description I'm going to put a link to my Google
Drive as always with all kinds of tuning files and information I'll be sure to put this in here you can I think it's on
Camaro 5. the latest version is 1.73 so if you have something older make sure
that you upgrade so I'm going to walk you through this a little bit this isn't made to be an end-all be-all walkthrough
of this but it's something there's there used to be a great video out there that went over this in depth but again that
channel is gone the video is gone so I want to get you started at least get you on the basics that you could feel
comfortable using this so when you first open it you're going to set it to 6l80
that's what we're talking about we have six gears our vehicle speed sensor has
36 pulses if we look in here you can see 36 so we're good and then we
have the gear ratios listed here and so you can go back into trans
gear ratios and you know it's pretty close there's a few decimals off I don't
know that it's really worth sweating the details but you can confirm and you can even edit it if you want to
the max speeds if you hover over this stuff you will get a tool tip display and so this is basically saying hey
don't change it it's just for reference so in my case let's say well I want to shift actually at 6 900 RPMs
so I'm just going to change all of these guys and this tool will get you in the
ballpark it's not going to be a home run right but it should be a really good starting point
so then it says okay well what's your final gear and again if we look in Speedo I have 327 I think some trucks
it's a mismatch what your actual gear is versus what HP tuner says or the factory
calibration so be aware of that 26 and a half was my
tire my idle is 700. and then this guy again you can read all
that my stall converter got 3600 stall
I don't ever lock it up until fifth gear and lock up config
again I have a single disc converter so I never want to lock it at wide open throttle
so I don't know if we can disable this somehow
um but we're going to talk about the torque converter in a subsequent video but the
option is there to mess around with it now you're going to pick the car closest to you I have a Chevy SS which is a
Holden Commodore and the G8 is a hold in Commodore so we're going to pick that and now this factor and offset and up
and down this is you know if you remember me talking about that S curve this is going to be how you can dial
this in with these numbers um you know I haven't really used this tool much I used it at first and I
quickly migrated away from it just because it's hard for me to see I'd
rather have like having these 2D graphs I think is great
maybe okay well that totally disappeared on me but
I like being able to look at these graphs on here you know and you can drag and move these things up as you want to
um and it kind of helps you get dialed into kind of the ZIP code that you want to to make this work
so I find this a little bit harder like what is this doing exactly like you can look here and kind of see
if you are Rain Man and you can look at all these numbers and memorize them
um and again you know hover over it it's going to tell you a little bit
but either way you're going to get this kind of set up how maybe you think you have an initial
solution for this this point now you're going to go to export and you get to the export window
and so now you have it says main shift table now each operating system is going
to be a little bit different so if I go to my up shift
and then my downshift that's two tables but here it's saying is it's one so you're gonna have to like
copy out if you do a copy table it's going to do the whole thing we don't want that so
now we do copy and come in here and paste it and then we'll do the downshift side
and go through there and now we're going to hit next and so this is fifth again I have up
shift Fifth and I have downshift fifth are two different tables so I'm going to copy this guy
I'm going to copy this guy paste it in there and so basically and
if you have a two column wide open um because I think some of them uh you have
upshift and downshift next to each other so you can format it when you get to those tables so if we keep hitting next
you're just going to keep copying all of these things out so there's I'm talking about as far as a two column table which
I don't have maybe you do but either way you can do that so you're just going to keep hitting next and copying this stuff
over and after we get through the shift scheduling and wide open we're going to hit some of the torque converter tables
so this would be first gear you know like one through three it's not locking
up and then we get to fifth gear and this is the lock and unlock and so you know you would just go to your torque
converter and come to apply a release and then you could start popping these things over
so again be patient we'll get the torque converters next but I just wanted while we're talking about it give you a
rundown of this tool so you're just going to keep hitting next and looking at whatever it's telling you up here to
copy and you're just going to move these things in I think this is a great starting point But ultimately your butt butt feel your
butt Dyno is going to be a much better calibration for what's right what feels
good what does the car want to do it's just software um so use it as a starting point but
make sure you Branch out from there um I think
that's the main thing that I wanted to cover today but let's talk about a
couple other things real quick so number one let's talk about one other a few other things as far as
hacks so tap up tap down so we have the factory says up down
request is enabled so on my car it's a stick in the console and you know you
pull it down toward you to get into drive and then it also has sport mode and for that you just kind of knock it
over to the right and it goes into sport mode and then from there if you want to
go into tap up tap down or you know manual shifting then you can start rocking it back and forth
I don't really like that I've found too many times where it's like hey I'm anticipating getting in a race or I'm
gonna go around a corner in a second the last thing I want this transmission to do is up shift by itself and then I need
to manually command to downshift and RPMs are going to flare and get crazy
um I would just rather skip sport mode altogether and so in my scenario I've
just disabled this here and so now as soon as I knock that stick over into
what used to be sport mode it's automatically tap up tap down and you
inherit the transmission at whatever gear it's in so if I'm cruising off the
stoplight and I make it to third gear and I say don't shift ever again until I tell you
I just flip that stick over to sport mode which is deleted it's now tap up tap down I get the transmission in
manual mode and third gear I'm ready to go Full Throttle or do whatever crazy shenanigans that I need to do and I
don't have to worry about commanding an up or downshift to force it to get into manual mode I really like this
now as far as other hacks for the shift scheduling for tap up tap down
if we look in the factory tune we can see it says first gear
if you're in tap up tap down go ahead and make that second gear shift as soon as you hit 47 miles an hour
that is impossible with the factory gearing you'll never hit 47 miles an hour in first so basically it's never
going to shift by itself same thing for second gear you're never going to hit 75 it's never going to automatically shift
and then same thing for three to four you cannot hit 115.
so what I've done is my wide open shifting if I come into
here let's get rid of the graph
yeah so this is my normal wide open shifting 33 58 and 93 miles an hour I've
copied those over to the last three cells now I've tried this
at just putting it at 100 so you know like this
well if I can get this guy well I can't copy because I'm in compare
one but either way it was I just set the last column to 100 100 to these values
and it didn't work so you're going to need to have it maybe I didn't try it in two columns but I know for sure it works
as long as the last three columns are set and so this is going to save you some embarrassment and maybe some lost
races so if you have gone into manual mode and you've forgotten to up shift that
red line or wherever it is this is going to say man I got your back I will shift for you you're not going to
hit the rev limiter and the chances of you losing a race is greatly reduced so
this is a lifesaver put these in here and you can see I've also done the same thing for up shift for fifth
well I just max that out so it won't even shift into fifth that wide open
throttle again for safety who needs that so at least for the the normal gears
that you're always going to be in this is a huge thing that I love doing now the other thing by the way drives me
crazy on the factory tune if we go over here to the downshift
you'll notice and this is from my understanding this is the same way on the g8s as the Chevy SS I don't know
about the Camaro Corvettes trucks SUVs so on and so forth but the 2-1 downshift was commanded at
zero miles per hour in other words you're in tap up tap down and you're slowing down to a stoplight
it will never shift downshift into first gear it will downshift to second gear
and stay in second gear and then when you take off from the light you leave it in second
super annoying so if you bump this up and set it to five
now it will automatically downshift into fifth gear so the way essentially I have this setup
in general is manual mode tap up tap down kind of
reads my mind I put it over here I delete sport mode and by the way if you're a canyon Carver do an autocross
or something you probably don't want to delete sport mode but Street driving drag racing heck yeah do it I love it
so we have this sport mode deleted and then you know tap up tap down kind of reads your mind it's basically saying at
the extremities of the throttle it should do what it should do which is up
shift when it needs to and downshift when it needs to I mean you don't want to be you know idling coasting down in
sixth gear and not have it downshift that's lame because then when you go Full Throttle you're not going to go
anywhere so this is a lifesaver highly recommend doing that as well so make sure that you
touch up all of these tables and make sure that they match get them where you want to
all right so let's talk about a little bit more of an advanced topic which is going to be
Optimum shift points for wide open throttle so I've done a kind of a basic sketch
here and you can see we have the axis of time and acceleration so as you're accelerating assuming you
never lift the throttle this is probably what you're going to experience a lot of acceleration a plateau and then
underwhelming performance as you are pulling too many RPMs and you're not generating power and so this is kind of
what it's going to kind of feel like and so really in my opinion and there's there's
lots of stuff out there if you go out there and you look to find Optimum shift points they're going to have you looking
at you know Dyno graphs and all this other kinds of stuff and there may be some value in that but at the end of the
day physics B physics and you can tell when the car is pulling is the g-forces the
g-forces are indicating that the car is accelerating or not and I think that's
the best way to identify when is the best time to shift so in
this case you can see third gear I mean our our g-forces are getting smaller but
guess what they're still positive g-forces and so if I'm going to shift down into a much lower RPMs into fourth
year I have to now build those RPMs back up to before I can even get to a break
even or a match point of this so why would I want to trade More g-forces For
Less g-forces not not good the opposite you can get upside down and
you can wait too long which is hey third gear is petered out and now finally I
can up shift well you've waited too long we don't want to do that either the ideal scenario is we want to be even
Steven we're just the perfect handoff hey I'm ready to give it to you you can take over where I left off everything is
nice and perfect well how can you do that um so there are a couple ways one you
know everybody's got smartphones you can get apps on your phone like the torque app is free and I'm sure there's others
out there that you can measure and record g-forces um and you know you don't even need the
OBD2 dongle for that but it'll log out to a CSV file and you can see what those
are doing now it might be kind of hard to match those up to when a shift actually occurred but if you did have an
OBD2 dongle you could at least get the RPMs and kind of compare from there
you can also in HP tuners build your own acceleration math parameter so I'll show
you what I have very simple we have the vehicle speed in my case
miles per hour and I'm looking back a quarter of a second that's milliseconds
so 0.125 seconds an eighth of a second backwards and an eighth of a second
forward so a total of a quarter of a second we're averaging the speed
and you can play with this number like you could bump it up to plus or minus 1000 which would be one second which is
going to give you a nice smooth swooping curve but in this case we're looking at
a trip I did at the drag strip and one second is just it's too smooth and Too Perfect
so if we look in here let's add it let's see what what we have
so max um put in six
decimals we'll put in one let's take a look at this so now this is Jagged line so you're
going to have to kind of manually visually filter through this but let's take a look we can see here we're in
first gear and here we're seconds so let's look at this first gear shift
so you can see that we have some funky data here going on so we need to decide
well is this the last valid bit of data or maybe this one so we'll look it's
either 2.5 I'm looking over here it's either 2.5 or 2.6 and now we need
to say okay well at what point did second gear take over did we get valid data so about in here
so 2.3 to 2.4 so honestly you know pretty impressed with myself that's not
I mean that's pretty close it's not perfect and I think in all cases I've kind of figured out that I'm I'm shifting way
too early and but again I don't want to rev this thing out it's four-door
streetcar weekend car fun car it's not a dedicated drag strip car so I'm not trying to shift at 8000 RPM so 6900 is
plenty fine for me now when we come over here it gets a little bit fuzzier
so what is the last bit of valid data over here maybe 1.5
and then we come over here well where's the first valid data
maybe over here 1.8 so not bad but pretty close we traded
1.5 for 1.8 not perfect ideally they would be the same but this is how you're
going to kind of go through and at least get a rough idea of if you have a good shift spot
and Just for kicks we'll edit this thing
and I'll show you if you make these numbers too big it makes for a nice pretty graph but
kind of hard to read
that's to force it to refresh
[Music] so there you go so
one second I mean look at that that's nice gorgeous data but where did the
shift occur like it's always going down like you can't really tell where the good spots are
so but you can play with that formula and see what works for you and kind of log and see what it's like obviously
there's other apps like draggy um it will give you the broad picture of everything lumped together but as far as
individual gear shifts I don't know the dragging is really going to help too much but at least it does provide some
type of objective data time wise of what's better or not but still you're
going to be at the mercy of whatever traction and whether are available this is going to be hard to compare run to
run where GeForce is GeForce you can tell in that same run did you trade more
g-forces for less or vice versa so hopefully that'll help you get stuff dialed in for wide open throttle

all right guys welcome back hey um I'm
working up the next series for this one
dealing with torque management but on
the way working through that I realized
I had kind of a brain wave dealing with
some of the stuff that we talked about
in the last one and I wanted to to touch
on that real quickly so I'm going to
release an addendum to the time and
pressure one
um and actually this is going back to
the very first part that I really talked
about which is that inertia Factor
profile stuff that that one through nine
or the 0 through 16 we were talking
about kind of in the history
so I was looking at this more carefully
and I think I have a pretty good working
idea of what is going on with this now
I've never heard anybody talk about this
stuff
um I may be totally off base so if you
know of different or know better or have
any corrections please please chime in I
would love to learn from you if you have
any knowledge or input on this my goal
is to help the community and so I just
ask that you do the same
so we have three tables here that we're
going to be exploring today well maybe
you know more than that but the three
main ones at least for an example
so in the shift timing up shift tab we
have this initial and if we look at this
the clue that HP tuners gives us is the
initial turbine acceleration to maximum
turbine acceleration and I believe in
the video the first one I did I said
this is a quarter of a second but I
meant to say this is percent
and if we look at this 0.2 or 0.25 that
is 0.2 percent that's not 20 percent so
if we look at our you know what a
coincidence here this is 0.2 seconds
but 0.2 percent of 20 seconds is 0.4
milliseconds like this is not a lot of
time this is a very small amount of time
but this is going to be whatever this
number comes out to be is going to be an
Adder to our total shift time next
we get to the final normal and this is
the clue is the from Maximum turbine
acceleration to final turbine so the
first one was initial to Max and then
this is Max to final and these are much
larger numbers in here but they are
still percents and even though they're
larger numbers again if we use this as
an example uh 1.3 milliseconds not a lot
of time
but again this is a shift Adder now the
real goofy one in here is this desired
output torque Factor scalar whatever
it's called and this is interesting so
this is also an Adder but a negative
number is obviously going to subtract
the interesting thing is is like for me
number seven here starts out as zeros
and then we start getting negative
numbers no units are listed but I'm
pretty sure this is actual seconds so
the other two are adding shift time and
this one is removing shift time so let's
see how all of these things work
together
so here are the tables
RPM and torque will determine our shift
time and also determine what you know
zone or what factor profile that we're
going to use
in here and then these are the tables
that contain the data for each one of
those profiles
so as you can see RPM and torque so the
next thing we're going to talk about
after this video is torque management so
the kind of this is an interesting
transition no pun intended
um of of getting there so let's look at
this by example so let's say we have a
desired shift time of 0.26 seconds
that's going to be the number that we
just put in there ad hoc to make it feel
nice
and then we have the initial transition
and final transition let's just add in
some dummy numbers to give us a nice
round 0.3 seconds for our final shift
time even though we just declared we
want 0.26 final after the adders is
going to be 0.3
so now we need to look at this output
torque Factor thing
and again 7 is the interesting one it
starts out as zeros and then we start
getting negative numbers and if we look
over here
this is shift completion so this is zero
percent we just started the shift 10
through our shift thirty percent forty
percent all the way down to one which is
one hundred percent
so let's walk through this
here we go our our initial shift 0.3
seconds we look at the inertia Factor at
zero percent and it's zero so we do
nothing so we're still we need to wait
0.3 seconds then we look at ten percent
and so now 10 percent of our time is
gone
so we now are no longer waiting point
three seconds we have 0.27 seconds
remaining but we look down here to ten
percent row and it says don't do
anything keep waiting
so this trend continues now we hit 50
percent and so if we look in here fifty
percent is our first number
so half of our time has gone 0.15 is
half of 0.3 and it says subtract out
.0498 seconds well guess what we still
have a positive number here so we still
wait
where things change we keep doing that
and then we hit this eighty percent row
and by this time eighty percent of our
time has passed and we need to wait .06
seconds
but now we subtract out point zero nine
nine six seconds and we come up with a
negative number and it says guess what
your shift is done we do not we do know
we do not have to wait uh for this
turbine to do whatever its turbine thing
that it is doing we can break out and
let's just drop that shift
so basically all this inertia Factor
profile this desired output is checking
back every 10 percent or so like you can
see this isn't you can see it like it
skips point two and it skips 0.7 so
we'll just for now call it ten percent
if we reach the bottom of this list and
we're still at a positive number then
we're done with this shift and we're
just gonna exit out but otherwise if we
keep subtracting and we get a negative
number we're good to go
so what does this do what is this
modeling so this is the same way that we
characterize fuel injectors or we
mathematically model transient fueling
which is how much fuel is puddling on
the intake track and you know
evaporating out or sticking to it we're
mathematically modeling and
characterizing the turbine for our
torque converter
that is to say how efficient it is or
how much slippage is going on so that
first table this initial acceleration is
hey we started the shift this turbine is
going to do its turbine things for an up
shift it's actually going to decelerate
you know that's why the RPMs drop on
your engine when you up shift when you
downshift then it will accelerate
positively
but either way this is our initial this
is that table at least for the one two
shift that's the the number and then we
reach maximum acceleration or
deceleration and then we have the final
which is saying hey now this has got to
slow down or speed up to its actual
final RPM rate so
the only other Oddball that goofy table
is that desired output torque Factor
thing this gives us a chance to break
out early so in those high performance
situations where we have a lot of RPMs
and a lot of torque and it's it's making
that turbine move faster or slow down
faster right so we have the ability to
break out early and that's what this red
line represents
so putting it all together when we look
at this
our torque converter has three parts the
impeller which is connected directly to
the engine the stator which does torque
multiplication and other crazy fluid
dynamical type things and then we have
the torque converter turbine the turbine
is connected one to one directly to the
input shaft of the transmission
this orange these two things represent
the clutch right you can see they're not
touching so this is disengaged
so you know off off going clutch is
disengaged in oncoming clutches
disengaged the wheels differential
output shaft this is all just free
spinning during the shift and this part
is free spinning as well so we have
torque reduction doing torque reduction
things to the um crankshaft here slowing
down the engine but this is still
spinning and whatever fluid coupling is
going on between the impeller stator and
turbine this is doing whatever that
fluid is telling it to do some
converters are tight and they're going
to respond A Lot quickly and more uh you
know efficiently I guess to say maybe
that's a misuse of the word in terms of
converter efficiency but some converters
are going to be loose and that turbine
may be a little bit lazy at least in
some RPM or operating conditions
so
really all that we're doing here is just
characterizing this turbine because for
the factory Engineers they want that
smooth shift so you don't want a huge
differential between this input shaft
which is you know kind of fluidly
coupled to the engine and then the
output shaft to have vastly different
speeds we want to give enough time for
this shaft speed to normalize and match
so kind of like rev matching essentially
if we wait too long the car speed will
slow down and make a slow shift and
that's going to feel goofy but we need
to wait long enough to allow this shaft
to normalize
normalize its speed so again it's a
balance of speed to get smoothness
so then where does that exactly leave us
what do we do with this information and
to be honest I don't really know part of
me will say I think the correct answer
is if you have your factory torque
converter leave those transition times
alone at least if you want a smooth
shift which I would suggest doing
if maybe you've swapped out the 6l80
converter and now you have a 6L 90
converter then look through some Factory
Tunes from a 6l90 car and get a sense
for what those transition times are
doing
if you have an aftermarket converter
then you know all bets are off I would
imagine you could probably safely lower
those turbine transition times to be
more aggressive simply because those
converters most likely you have a high
stall converter they're going to slip
more so there's less fluid coupling
between the impeller or stator and
turbine and it's going to be loose
anyway so even you know it should spin
up and slow down a lot easier with less
effect or disrupting the apple cart I
don't know maybe uh I have a Circle D
converter it's a 3600 stall I may reach
out to Circle D and see what they say
and if I get any type of feedback or
something I'll be sure to report back
all right uh that is everything oh wait
no bonus material so this is actually
going to be a sneak peek for the next
one uh presentation I'm doing of torque
management
so we have this 45 degree line this is
going to represent maybe a perfect shift
or if not a perfect shift it's going to
recognize
or represent I should say what if we
never shifted and we just kind of
indefinitely kept accelerating this
thick black line down here is going to
represent your seat of the pants feel
when you're driving in the car what does
it feel like when you're sitting there
so the first part optionally you know if
it applies we're going to unlock the
converter
torque management will be applied which
is the next video that we're going to
talk about
then we have the oncoming clutch fill
which is going to be controlled by the
adaptives both in well just the volume I
should say then the off-going clutch is
going to disengage we have adaptive here
controlling how much pressure then we
have this turbine transition
characterization this off-going clutch
is disengaged and then the next part is
we're going to wait before we engage
this clutch so this is just dead time
everything that we talked about today
this turbine characterization is how
much time do we wait with no clutches
engaged just to allow that shaft to do
whatever it wants to do to normalize its
RPM
sometimes we exit early sometimes we
wait the full time it just sort of
depends
then after that waiting time is done
we engage the clutch and this is all
stuff internal to the transmission
and then you know the torque management
which we're about to talk about in the
next video this is external to the
transmission
and then we're going to unlock the
clutch and then away we go into amazing
awesomeness of the 6l80e propelling US
onwards and upwards to the Future and to
Victory well thanks for your time and
thanks for listening again if you have
any feedback or if you have any other
thing that I've missed or Corrections
please I implore you fellas let me know
all right thanks bye

decisions as well as accepting the
consequences of those decisions I cannot
be held accountable for your actions
all right fellas
um I realized I did a really terrible
job explaining how to account for or
solve for shifting it wide open throttle
and the reason why is because you always
have to lead the shift time so if we
look in the editor here's what we have
this is from the normal wide open miles
per hour and RPMs and in all cases I
have mine set to shift Peak RPM at 6900
RPMs and all of these shift RPMs are
really low and then the corresponding
miles per hour is going to be low
compared to that 6900 RPM shift point so
we need to account for that lag or that
delay and so that's what this calculator
is for so the first thing we're going to
do is plug in our observed wide open
shift numbers here and when I say
observed where we want to get this is
you can see this top graph here
we have this yellow line is the current
gear and I'm going to move this cursor
right to where it hits four and then
maybe back off till it's the last frame
for three
and then I'm going to capture these guys
and I want that because I this is where
the commanded shift point is and so you
can see the line jump up here but I want
to get that last moment of what was
happening in third gear so I can get
that that torque converter slip and all
those other variables kind of calculated
in so you see 97 point or 95.7 and 64.53
so this is where these numbers came in
here and we could put in 0.7 if you like
decimals is fine
and so now we're going to say well what
is it actually being commanded at now
for example this isn't the same but we
would plug in
this guy here for the two three or the
three four shift whatever it may be just
grab this number and plop it in here
whatever it is and then we're going to
say well I actually want to shift at 6
900 RPMs so it says well you're going to
take about 200 RPMs to complete the
shift so we're going to subtract that
off and then we're going to come up with
this 66.97 and then we're going to back
calculate the miles per hour and so this
6697 should correspond to 99 miles per
hour
this is the way that I did my car just
because it's not a dedicated track car I
want to keep the RPMs mild and tame just
for you know driving around on the
street not trying to rebuild engines if
you have some hardcore track car
and you know the size of the tire and
the gearing and you want to match those
shifts up to get whatever you want right
at the the Finish Line whatever the case
may be you might need to solve for miles
per hour
which is what this one is it's the exact
same thing only we're calculating the
shift lead time in terms of miles per
hour and then we're back calculating the
RPM
so choose your weapon most of you
probably should be using this and then
we're just going to take these numbers
here and then we're going to plug them
back in
so I would say well you know my two
three shift
three four I think we were actually
dealing with we'll make it 66.97 and
miles per hour is 99 so you know we'll
put it uh 99 or whatever the case may be
now these are made up numbers so I
actually don't want to save those but
whether you do from here or here it's
the same just copy the numbers in green
but remember you're going to need to
come into here oh these are
metric that's why they look odd all
right so once you do that though you
still will need to make sure that you
update this number to match
um
otherwise it may shift funky and it may
not be totally reliable and if you have
also done the tap up tap down modifier
like I like optional you don't have to
make sure you update those last three
cells and then the same thing for the
tap up tap down miles per hour in RPM
basically you're going to need to update
all of these wide open areas
so
the first time you do this it you
probably get pretty close the only the
the hold up is
when we look in here at the commanded
shift
um miles per hour versus RPM we don't
know if this relationship is accurate
somebody probably dropped those in or
factory tune is probably spot on but
either way if you have a new torque
converter and you're just kind of
guessing
the first time it tries to back
calculate the miles per hour from the
RPM may be a little bit sketchy so this
is probably something you will have to
do two or three times and just observe
how it's going and then you may get to a
point where hey you know it is Shifting
at let's say 6600 and we're actually at
94 and so you know now it's getting a
lot smaller the the lead time or
whatever and so then we'd say well what
I can't remember what that one was but
either way
you may have to iterate and do a couple
times to get this just so this
relationship between the RPM and miles
per hour tightens up a little bit so I
apologize uh first time I didn't really
explain that very well in fact I did a
terrible job so accept my apologies this
spreadsheet calculator I'm going to put
also out on my Google Drive so follow
the link in the video description to
grab it if you so want and if you have
any questions again feel free to hit me
up anyway onwards and upwards my dudes

welcome back let's continue our
conversation on the 6l80e talking about
the torque converter this will probably
be our last video I'll probably have a
wrap up conclusion final thoughts thing
just to throw in some miscellaneous
stuff but this is the last real content
now you would think that we would just
go right here to torque converter in
general but we are not going to go there
uh we're gonna make one small change
over here on the torque management tab
you'll notice there's a stall torque
management section right here with an
enable and disable RPM now I'm going to
be honest with you I'm not 100 positive
what this does but general rule of thumb
is everybody Maxes this out and if we
look at this I'm going to flip it back
over to the OEM values
when I first got this car everybody said
you know all the internet experts said
the factory stall converter is about
1600 RPMs and so here we see this is set
to 1500 so what I think is going on is
basically
this is just saying hey right before we
actually hit the actual stall RPM of the
converter now we will begin
some torque reduction to save the
transmission below this RPM the
converter slip in and all the power is
lost in the slip and not a lot of torque
is being transferred to the transmission
Above This RPM though we are getting
significant torque transmitted through
the input shaft and downstream so that's
when we need to start thinking about
enabling some torque management
so my guess is if we are above this RPM
1500 we're going to go over here to the
engine side under torque management and
in general and now we can start seeing
some more transmission settings in here
and you recall we kind of visited this
when we were talking about virtual
torque but basically I'm guessing it's
going to say hey if you're above that
1500 limit
we can't allow more than 115 foot-pounds
for this RPM and so on and so forth
actually this is Newton meters now foot
pounds but we're going to limit the
torque to this amount of stuff so I
believe this that 1500 in our example is
where this stuff is really going to
start to be coming activated
so we're going to go to transmission
over here and you can see mine is maxed
out I mean if you followed so far you
know I shifted 6 900 RPMs I'm never
going to hit this high so that's pretty
safe
so that's the first setting
um and I would say even if you have a
factory converter go ahead and Max that
out we don't want to be limited I think
it's still pretty safe to disable this I
mean I'm still running the stock
transmission I've
over 200 horsepower at the crank and
wheels or whatever from the factory an
aftermarket converter and you know 121
000 miles or something it's running
great
so the other spot then is the torque
converter and the first thing one of the
most important things go to these
desired slip tables and zero them out
you do not want slipping in your torque
converter especially an aftermarket
converter they're not really rated for
that and one of the main failure points
for the factory OEM converter is they
slip it generates heat and then where
the ears the tabs or the bosses are
welded on there are stresses in there
and that heat begins to warp those
stresses and then you start getting
chattering you get slipping you get
banging the friction materials wearing
off you absolutely do not want slip it
it literally blows my mind why the OEM
would come in here if we look here go
back to factory they're allowing up to I
thought yeah up to 35 RPMs of slip
um and all of these have values in them
we don't want slip so why would they put
that in there then well I think it's
just the user experience of if you have
a little bit of slip it reduces some
Shock from the drive to drive line that
nvh noise vibration and harshness
whether it's just kind of some bucking
or surging from the engine or just in
general uh maybe you have a rough shift
that that torque converter even if it's
locked up can allow a little bit of a
little bit of give and take to make
things smooth and seamless
um I'm totally fine
um dealing with a little bit of noise
vibration and harshness for the life of
the converter so come in here and zero
out all of these tables including get
this guy this is AC off this is AC on
and even though my LS3 did not come with
DOD I go I went ahead and disabled it
because I'm paranoid and I zero it out
every single one of these things you do
not want slipping this is how you ruin
your torque converter your aftermarket
torque converter or factory so zero
those bad boys out so the next thing
thing that we have to deal with in terms
of slipping and preventing the slipping
are the adaptives now in general I am a
fan of the adaptives they are there to
make sure that we use as little pressure
as is needed to get the job done without
damage so on the right side torque
converter clutch adapt
the first part we have some rules the
minimum temperature of which the
Adaptive learning will take place or it
will attempt to adapt the slipping and
then the Max and then throttle position
Min and Max now this is interesting this
is the factory setting this is saying
the minimum amount of torque I have to
be making at least 26 foot pounds of
torque but no more than 30 foot pounds
of torque so depending on this is
inclusive or exclusive that's either a
four foot pound range or maybe a six
foot pound range that the adaptives will
be in play which is Goofy and I compared
to some other vehicles Corvettes and
Camaros and SUVs and this was set to
like a minimum of zero and a maximum of
300. so why Holden decided to make this
car this way I don't know this is at
least the 2014 setting maybe the 15 16
and 17s are different I don't know then
you also have the vehicle speed sensor
minimum and maximum speeds so it doesn't
look like a whole lot of adapters are
going to be going on and I'm fine I
really don't want to change that
but down here and yours will probably be
different and I would discourage you
from disabling the adaptives and this
way maybe perhaps this can help you we
do have some control over the adaptives
so the minimum if I revert back to stock
that's saying you know what I'm going to
allow you to remove 250 kPa of pressure
from the torque converter lockup if you
think you can get away with it so start
removing pressure and then when it
starts slipping kind of maybe bump it
back up a click and call it good and
then the maximum here is going to be
well I will allow you up to 250 kPa for
your budget to add
pressure to prevent slipping
so you may want to
go in here and I'm paranoid which is why
I've done this I've set this to zero I'm
not saying you should or you have to but
it's something to consider to eliminate
some type of slipping if you are
experiencing it
so this is me saying I'm never going to
under any circumstance allow you to
remove line pressure from the torque
converter I will though allow you to add
250 kPa to that line pressure to keep
things nice and tight and locked up so a
couple other things dealing with torque
converter pressures we have this desired
pressure and you can see this is a
three-dimensional graph you have line
pressure over here in PCA pressure
assuming this is pressure control
actuator or something there's you'll see
some settings when you get into the
scanner PCS which I'm pretty sure stands
for pressure control solenoid
so you know you have the Baseline
pressure over here and then the actuator
over here commanding whatever pressure
is needed to lock it up and then of
course we have the max pressure which is
our cap right here now this little
rascal right here does the opposite of
what you think
so this is
when we need to lock up the converter
how fast do we want to slam that thing
together closed and you would think
Common Sense would say well the bigger
the number the more pressure and the
faster it will close and lock up but no
you would be wrong if you thought this
these numbers are actually opposite
so the smaller the number the faster
this will close and lock up and this
makes sense then in the context of zero
because this is saying hey if the uh if
there's no slipping right now and we
need to lock up now is our chance we can
slam this converter closed and there
will be no slip whenever we lock it up
versus over here if we have 400 RPMs of
slip we have the largest numbers in this
graph and it's going to say all right
well let's take our time and let's
slowly close this it's just like dumping
the clutch in a manual transmission
you know you can dump the clutch when
there's zero RPMs and nothing's going to
happen but if your engine spinning at
400 RPMs and you just try to dump the
clutch well you're going to stall it
most likely so the bigger the number the
slower it engages so you probably want
to bump these up or when I say bump them
up I should say bump them down to make
it close a little bit harder again to
prevent that slipping from going on and
then the cap everything this will keep
everything under control right here I
have been meaning to reach out to Circle
D
um that's my torque converter and see
what they have any guidance on here as
far as Max pressures or any strategies
but I guess I'm freaking lazy I just
haven't done that yet so I've just in
general kind of bumped these up and
crossed my fingers I haven't had any
problems yet I'm not saying that's the
best way to do things but
um one day I'll reach out and you know
get the manufacturer's opinion on this
stuff
all right so a couple other things in
here the trans adapt you have the cell
preloads and cell break points I
wouldn't recommend updating or changing
anything in here this is going to be
basically
the data structure in the background as
far as the learning is involved for
managing the adapts just like
the ECM has the long-term fuel trims and
there's that fuel trim cell and that
fuel trim cell represents idle part
throttle wide open throttle open loop
solid Evap solenoid on or off so on and
so forth I would just go ahead and leave
these in here leave those alone
but we also have this shift lock now the
description on this guy is saying the
torque converter will remain locked
during shifts
so this is kind of interesting to me if
you have a triple disc or you know
torque converter this may be a good
option for you to leave locked if you're
single disc definitely don't do it if
you're shifting under power
um
but either way remember when we're
talking back if we can go back to it
shift timing this guy this turbine
transition well if we're keeping the
torque converter locked up then that's
going to negate really the need to allow
that turbine to do whatever it's going
to do because we're all locked together
as one solid Mass
anyway mine came disabled I'm not saying
you should or should not change it
um I would be interested to know if
anybody's transmission
came or the tune I should say
calibration came from the factory with
this enabled please chime in I would
like to know and learn more about that
so uh help help a brother out if you can
so let's go ahead and let's move over to
the supply release tab over here now
this for the most part is going to look
pretty similar to the shift timing for
part throttle as and Full Throttle type
stuff and these are going to be the
rules that are commanded in terms of
when do we lock the torque converter up
so if you are from the factory you will
start seeing
at times let's see if we have any for
mine yeah you can see third gear and
fourth gear this is going to start
locking up in the low 20 miles an hour
and up to the 30s and the 40s
and then release again just like the
downshift for the shift scheduling
you're going to make these a few mile an
hour less as well
if you have a high performance High
stall torque converter you probably are
not going to want to lock this up
in these lower gears it's going to cause
bucking it's not going to be happy and
you're just going to increase the
chances of things slipping getting hot
and shredding itself so I would not do
that
when I first got my car tuned I had two
places tuned it and both of them
commanded the torque converter to be
locked up at Full Throttle and so on the
dyno and doing high speed pulls you know
Full Throttle pulls to get logging I
could feel the torque converter slipping
but at the time I really was not
educated and so I've become
hypersensitive if you haven't been able
to tell about slipping converters
so for any high performance work you can
see that I have here
fifth gear is when I start to lock up a
little bit
um
a little kilometers per hour there you
go
so I was confused like wait I'm not
lopping locking this thing up at 92
miles an hour all right now we're back
to normal so in fifth gear you can see
I'm locking it up at 57 miles an hour
but once I start getting on the throttle
you know if I'm at 75 percent I'm going
to say I probably want to beat this
horse a little bit and make this thing
run so let's unrock it unlock it and
just let this thing eat
um and then you know for the fifth
release you can see now here's the
interesting thing that you're going to
see
is down here at zero percent throttle as
long as I'm under 317 miles an hour
which the car never goes that fast
um it's going to unlock and there is a
reason for this and that is because
the cam that I have being kind of Rowdy
as it is it it bucks really bad about
1700 RPMs to 2000 RPMs
so and that happens on acceleration and
deceleration
so if we go to shift scheduling and we
look at my up shift
you can see I'm shifting into fifth gear
potentially in the low fifth High 40s to
low 50s but I have a very small window
it rarely locks up in fifth gear
um
so most of the time I kind of blast
through fifth and I hit Sixth and then
eventually it will lock up but the point
being is this is kind of a workaround
for a big cam High stall car that wants
to Buck at low RPMs and so even if I
pull up sixth gear here we'll just put
these guys up here let's go back to
torque converter and we'll do sixth here
we go
so you can see I have the same strategy
torque converter doesn't lock up to 169
miles an hour and it unlocks as soon as
I release the throttle and this prevents
a lot of bucking which is a nice little
workaround that I like a lot so you can
experiment with this this is nice when I
let off the throttle the car just Glides
and just coasts forever it's really nice
if you don't have to worry about any
bucking or surging from the cam while
you're doing this and you want engine
braking then by all means leave it
locked up but I just want to give you a
workaround for any if you have some big
cams that you're trying to tame a little
bit
so again low gears one through four high
performance work don't even bother just
leave it unlocked ideally you would be
able to lock the converter
um keep in mind when it's not locked up
it's going to spin and it's going to
slip and when it does that it's
generating Heat and the transmission
fluid that ultimately has to be cooled
down
so bear that in mind slipping's not a
good thing
if you can avoid it
and then again like I said
um I set up all my normal stuff here and
then I copied it all the way down
Full Throttle as you can guess
um here we go kilometers per hour again
never lock no matter what in the low
gears fifth gear never lock no matter
what sixth gear never lock no matter
what so Full Throttle unless and now if
you do have a nice
um a triple clutch or more torque
converter that you can lock under wide
open throttle now you get to go into the
hole I'm at the drag strip and I get to
optimize when do I lock up the converter
at what speed and you can experiment
because you're essentially kicking in
another gear
so you you have that option so you know
if you're trying to get every little bit
out of it you at Full Throttle
you may whoops you may want to lock it
up at a certain speed in in fifth and
sixth gear
now
this whole time I've been telling you
that I want a consistent transmission no
matter what is going on no matter what
profile I am in whether it's normal
pattern a b you know there's that
pattern X Y and Z and then there's
normal mode in Special mode and then of
course there's tap up tap down here's
the only thing that I've done
differently and this is intentional
and that is
in fifth
and sixth and tap up tap down you'll
notice it's never locking up
again this is part throttle so if I go
here to fifth apply and sixth you can
see that I definitely have some numbers
in here 57 and 69 but here it never
locks up and the reason why is because
69 miles an hour is you know a little
bit awkward
as far as cruising on the highway this
is about as low as I can reliably get it
before it wants to start bucking so if
I'm on a highway and I'm you know you
can see I'm letting it go down to 55
miles an hour
so let's say I'm accelerating
I hit 69 70 miles an hour torque
converter locks up RPMs drop really low
but then traffic starts to slow down for
whatever reason well it's going to
continue to stay locked but if I have to
go down to 65 miles an hour or 60 miles
an hour and you know maybe it's going to
be a while depending on traffic in the
in the situation and it's starting to
Buck well no problem I can just flip my
stick over to sixth gear in sport mode
or tap up tap down I should say and the
converter will unlock now the bad news
is it's more RPMs it's worse gas mileage
it's more wear and tear on the motor
it's more Heat and the transmission
fluid but it certainly beats having a
cam that's bucking and surging and that
is unhappy with the scenario so this is
the only exception I make on my car
again you're going to have to tailor
this to your vehicle to make it work
okay
so I have these scanner open here I just
did a quick drive down the highway then
I logged a bunch of pids I really want
to talk about the transmission slipping
or torque converter slipping I should
say but I will show you there are quite
a few
um overall pressures that you can log
the interesting thing to me
when I zoom out and I look at the entire
this is what a seven and a half minute
run including a wide open Pole
um
look at those pressures they don't
exceed 758 kPa it looks like it does but
as soon as I zoom in
they all disappear so there's just some
graphic artifacts in there but look at
that they're all capped 758
and when we go back in here to shift
pressures
900 kPa and if I go back to the factory
tune
758.
so doesn't even look like I don't I
don't know what these guys are doing
max line pressure from the factory
again the star 726 and then it tapers
off for some reason
I've commanded higher here so on and so
forth so unless there are some other
um
but where am I going so unless there's
some other pressures involved that we
cannot log or access this is kind of
strange to me I don't really get it
um but whatever
um my transmission is working shifting
fine so I guess it's just one of those
things I don't ask questions and have to
accept
but this middle section here is the
torque converter
and as I zoom in really what I'm looking
at is the slip RPM and the pressure
so anytime that I have pressure
you can see it's maxed out at 758 I want
to make sure that I'm at zero now most
likely it'll never be perfectly zero
there'll be a little bit of jostling
here and there and that's okay
um but you can see this blue line
wherever it comes up we as long as we
have pressure here in the torque
converter we don't want to have any
slipping
and so you can see here's a spot where I
let off the throttle
and
it reduced the pressure and then we
started getting slipping and then I got
back on the throttle pressure increased
and then the slipping went down to zero
so we can look at some various other
things again as long as there's pressure
we don't want any slipping so this is
going to be your sanity check you're
going to want to log to make sure
and that no more other
so there's only what three events here
one two three
for this particular run where I had
pressure and I'm satisfied that I don't
have any slipping so that's a a good
thing
so make sure that you log these and you
check on them periodically
so I think that's going to do it for the
torque converter
um hope you got some out of it and
learned something if you have any
questions or other Insight from your
experience I'll be happy to hear those
things but anyway onwards and upwards my
dudes later

warning tuning your vehicle can be a dangerous activity and there is substantial risk involved the dangers
include but are not limited to permanently damaging your vehicle injury or death to yourself or other people
damaging personal property due to paying attention to a laptop while driving this
video is intended for educational purposes only before altering the
calibration of your vehicle you should verify it is in proper working and mechanical condition have a working
basis of knowledge of how your vehicle works and how the components interrelate and understand how your tuning software
works bottom line you and only you are responsible for making your own
decisions as well as accepting the consequences of those decisions I cannot
be held accountable for your actions all right my dudes welcome back to our
final installment of my 6l80e Series today is the last video we're going to
wrap everything up with just a few final thoughts and then I'm going to send you on your way to Victory Lane my brothers
all right so uh the first thing a couple tips and tricks here um is generally considered good practice
by hot rodders and gear heads to overfill the transmission by about a
quart and the reason why is under hard launches you know the fluid can slosh around and when the transmission goes to
try to pump that fluid it may find that it can't reach it so it's going to suck air and that can damage the transmission
so there are plenty of videos on YouTube of how to do that it's not that bad get
the car warmed up it's got to be between a certain temperature I I don't recall level ground you need to shift it in and
out of all the gears and then with the engine running uh you go underneath it and there's a a
plug a bolt basically that you unbolt and you know it's one of those things where it's got to drip a certain amount
not too much not too little but you kind of get a few dribbles and at that point it's considered full at that point go
ahead and dump in another quart now genetic racing they do make a dipstick and it's kind of nice the the
full line on there is indicative of an extra quart now I'm not sponsored by
Genetti I'm not sponsored by anybody I'm just a normal dude your average hot rodder you pay your money you take your
chances you learn your lessons you get bigger and better and faster and
stronger every time you fail so I don't take the money or anything from anybody
I mean hey if you want to sponsor me by all means I'll take your money right but uh I'm just gonna still tell it like it
is right so um anyway that's just one option there are other is out there the Genetti one
does look pretty much stock it's not exciting or you know action-packed or
Chrome or anything like that low carb makes one it's pretty nice and fancy but I think it does require you to drill
some holes into the firewall to mount it and for that reason I'm out dog I'm not
going to be drilling any extra holes for that type of stuff um now if you do have a aftermarket High
stall converter you're gonna need an auxiliary transmission cooler keep that fluid cool hot Transmissions
um are not having a good time so you definitely want to do that now there's some controversy involved of
okay you need an aftermarket cooler now what what a lot of guys do and I'm not a fan
of this is they're going to go out and they're going to buy the truecool 40K the biggest baddest cooler on the market
and then they are going to run the transmission lines directly to that and
then directly back bypassing everything else in the system and I'm not a fan of
that just like your engine you know they engineer it and they
design it for a specific weight viscosity of oil and that's based off of
operating temperature and the bearing clearances the transmission was not designed to be run with cold fluid it
needs some heat that's just how it was designed so I would encourage you
um and this now I'm speaking from a car perspective which you know my
understanding the cars didn't really have problems like the trucks did with the 6l80e if you're dealing with a truck
that's kind of out of my experience level so I'm don't listen to this cover
your ears close your eyes don't listen but for you car guys I'm going to say your best route is to run the lines to
the engine radiator and then from the radiator it goes to the factory thermostat and then the factory cooler
and then finally it goes to the aftermarket cooler and then that gets
routed directly back to the transmission now this has some advantages
number one when the transmission is cold running the lines through the factory
radiator is going to get that transmission fluid warmer quicker
once it's hot you know I got to imagine the transmission fluid is probably
significantly hotter than the um the engine coolant
so it's gonna get cool and you know the water to water or fluid to fluid cooling
is a lot more efficient than air to water so it's going to transfer that heat that
initial hot from that transmission to the radiator and it's going to cool off
from there it's going to go to the factory thermostat again it needs to have some heat we
can't just run super frigid air into the transmission it needs it needs the right
viscosity it's been engineered to run at a certain temperature so we want to keep that I want to say I
think for my car it was like that's 180 degree thermostat I believe something
like that um yours obviously maybe different and then you know you have the factory
transmission cooler um that's just free BTUs right you take
that and and use it I mean why get rid of it and then you can get a smaller
aftermarket auxiliary cooler so I would encourage you to keep that and you know don't take my word for it
monitor your transmission temperatures on my car is runs happy it's pretty much
like 180 degrees I mean it may sneak up a little bit on a hot day if I'm a
little hot and heavy on the throttle to 190 but rarely I think In The Heat Of
Summer does it get past 195 and that's still an exception but either way log
your transmission temps and HP tuners keep an eye on that look at it and if if you feel like you you need more cooling
then you can go and experiment from there and and try to figure something out but at least by default that's how
you should start also the lines on your your coolers should be facing up so that way air can
escape we don't want to have trapped air that's just going to prevent just like in your your normal engine coolant when
you have air bubbles heat can't transfer so you want to get rid of those air
bubbles so keep the uh the connection lines to the top not on the sides not on
the bottom you can also provide extra Cooling and fluid capacity by getting a deep pan conversion depending on you
know ride height that may be an issue I was looking at the b m one it adds 1.8
quarts of capacity and with the cooling fins they only stick apparently three
quarters of an inch lower than the factory pan so not that bad really I
mean hopefully you're not that close to the ground driving on the street anyway that's just something else to
consider so here's a picture of my setup you can see the coolers here it's mounted onto
the front bumper the internal you know bumper hidden behind the fascia and The
Grille and the a n fittings are pointed straight up and down for air to come out
OEM thermostat is in there if I ever have problems with overheating what I'll probably do
is just remove this thermostat and run without it and test it if that doesn't
work I may put it back in and then bypass the engine radiator and then if that doesn't work then may you know
bypass them both then I'll just run through the factory cooler and the aftermarket cooler but so far so good
I've had good luck it's working out good all right so the weak areas
um the factory jmbx converter is really the problem child so I found this great
picture of a cutaway view that someone did on the converter and basically you
know this is like the Piston that comes down under pressure and it can deflect
so you know we were talking about the the torque converter pressures and all that the apply ramp and all that kind of
jazz well too much pressure is going to cause it to warp or not warp but
deflector deform and so you can see you kind of have a small contact patch here
and so less contact less friction more slippage more heat so good news bad news
the friction material is this carbon weave which is very strong very tough and the fact that it's the carbon weave
well the carbon handles the heat great no problems and the weave actually allows transmission fluid to enter and
cool it even while it's locked up which is a good thing because you know locked
up you know the factory tables allow for slip so it's locked up and slipping fluid is still circulating in there
keeping it cool but the problem remains that slippage is still generating heat
and while that carbon weave says no problem I can handle the heat well that
heat has to go somewhere and so the front cover is one of those areas that
goes it's made of metal and that is a problem because here's a picture of my factory converter
and you can see these tabs this is the engine side right this is the flex plate
is right here and this would be you know facing the engine well here is the boss
that's welded on for the bolt hole and you can see it's welded on well you know
welding introduces tension and stress in the metal and when you start adding heat
it's now going to begin to Warp and as good as that carbon weave is at
dealing with heat and slipping the one weakness the Achilles heel that it has is it needs a flat smooth surface
so as the heat builds up this cover starts to warp a little bit and it just destroys that that carbon weave which is
only 20 thousandths of an inch thick and so then that carbon starts going through
the transmission fluid next thing you know you get metal to metal and bad
things happen and then you are not a happy camper by contrast here's a picture of my
personal Circle D converter and you can see it is a one piece Billet cnc'd
machined and it is a gorgeous gorgeous thing of beauty it is a shame to cover
that up with the flex plate and then throw that thing in just the bowels of the drivetrain never to be seen again
but it you know I'm happy I get to share this with you guys I hope you enjoy
looking at this as much as I do speaking of Circle D I said I would
maybe you know follow up with these guys see what they say their viewpoint on how
much pressure I should be using or not using to lock up the converter and I was so disappointed uh with their
reply I mean I get it right cya they don't know who's out there doing what and so they're just like you know go
hire someone else to tune your car you Noob I get it so at least I'm like well hey at least tell me like what's like
the maximum pressure right because you know after reading about the piston on the factory jmbx converter deflecting
Under Pressure I'm thinking man oh I hope I don't do that to mine like what
what's what's burst like if I buy an intake right and I'm gonna put a turbo
on it I'm probably gonna ask a manufacturer like what's maximum PSI I
can throw at this before it bursts right so I figured that's probably a safe question to ask about to converter but
no then they man and I you know I don't have anything good or bad to say about
6l80etuning.com I think I've heard positive and negative thing about them I have no personal experience right but
and same thing for mail order tuner but man they just doubled down and then just said go talk to mail order tuners
well that's that's brutal thanks guys I was expecting more oh well
all right as far as the other weak areas uh Full Throttle downshifts that tends
to to tear things up so you don't want to do that hopefully you can plan ahead
I mean I get it there's just some times where you're like screw this I'm out of here and you're just gonna dump the
throttle but if you can plan ahead use tap up tap down drop down
some gears and then pin the throttle and then hint hint uh you know if you're
doing that you're probably paying attention on not crashing or something more important things um rather than shifting or forgetting
the slap to stick back over into Auto or drive or whatever so you know having that tap up tap down
through the auto shift for you is just is the it's the right thing to do my man
go ahead and do it you know you want to okay now
let's get into some goofy stuff I'm gonna tell you this to set up the
next slide which is my biggest concern so um back in the day people noticed the
first two three shift you know first thing in the morning hey you know I'm gonna go to the office driving leaving
down the neighborhood and man that first two three shift is awfully Goofy well GM heard their complaints and
basically said it's air in the clutch solenoid like it's fine it's normal just
ignore it but if you're really that paranoid shift it into reverse which is
going to activate the right clutch packs and everything and basically fill it with fluid and
Purge the air and you know of course you don't even need to drive in Reverse but at least just make that that connection
into reverse and then hit drive so the people who never hit reverse
or I should say the people who did reverse maybe to get out of their garage they never noticed this right but the
people who parked on the street maybe in such a way that hey they just get in they drop it and drive and they go
they're the ones that saw this all right so keep this in mind for my my biggest
gripe and my biggest concern is the first wide open three four shift does
the same crap and it pisses me off now normal day-to-day obviously this
isn't a big deal but when I'm at the drag strip it definitely it just ticks me off you know
um and so the reason why is because you know you normally make a pass and then depending on how busy it is that night
you may not get another pass for 15 minutes half hour maybe it's an hour so
you're sitting there with the hood up trying to keep everything from heat soaking and then you get back in the car
you know you're idling you know through the pits and the staging Lanes whatever you get up there and it's finally like
okay this is it like I've been waiting an hour to make this pass and you know for me man the it's like
you're you're halfway down the track or whatever and it's the very last shift you know this three to four shift at
least for my gearing and it hangs it does a shift it takes forever to shift
into fourth and while it's waiting to shift the RPMs just continue to rise and
rise and then it does a hard shift and I hate it now this was really a problem on street
tires because when you're on street tires you know you drive around the water box because you don't want to get
them wet because all the Sipes and the tread and you can't do a big burnout because street tires aren't made for
that kind of heat and they gum up and they ball up and you lose traction so you just got to do a little baby burnout
to keep them happy so that's a problem now after I went to radials and I'm
doing a big nice Smoky burnout in the water box I didn't realize it till I got home and I was looking at my my logs
from HP tuners it shifted into fourth gear uh just in the burnout which pretty
insane but um so I never had those issues but I'm still
I'm not really a fan so you know the only workarounds you know drive as fast
as you can and hopefully get it into fourth gear you know as you're you're working the staging Lanes probably you
can it's probably not safe to do that I wouldn't even recommend doing it right
um or you just hot lap it which you know again depending on the night that may not be possible
so here's the thing a lot of people say I don't know what you're talking about this is imagineer it's all in your head
and I think it goes back to you know are you the type of person that reverses out
of the garage are you the type of person that parks on the street depending on how you drive the car in your individual
situation you may never see this so I'm asking you test this out yourself most
likely if you're listening to this video you got a little secret spot you know
you don't tell everybody where it's at maybe just your buddies but your testing
spot go there get the engine nice and hot warmed up ready to go never go full
throttle on a cold or partially warmed up engine but get to your spot turn the
car off don't open the door because when you do that deactivates computers blah
blah blah I want you to experience this the way that GM wanted you to experience it turn off the car stay in the car
don't open the door don't take off your seatbelt wait a few minutes and you're going to start hearing the computers
shutting down I mean it's not going to be beeps or whatever but you're gonna hear clicking sounds
and that my theory is as power is removed the solenoids that's holding
fluid in the transmission relax fluid drains out allowing air to enter so once
you hear those clicks after a few minutes go ahead start the car up and get her into wide open throttle I mean
you may have to shimmy around a little bit to get to your your ideal spot but just as long as you
don't let it go into fourth gear before you get into wide open throttle you're
going to feel and see and hear that that shift hang I've tried in the tune you
know like if I could change the tap up tap down to a much lower value for fourth gear
maybe it'll let me shift into fourth gear at five miles an hour or because I can be at idle zero miles an hour I can
shift into third but I cannot the computer the car whatever is not going
to let me shift into fourth gear I can't remember if it's like 37 or 39 miles an
hour maybe it's 41. I can't remember the the number but there's no way around it
the only car that I think it's possible to do this on is the C6 Corvette because
the tap up tap down is routed directly to the transmission but all other cars
the wiring for tap up tap down goes through the BCM the body control module
that intercepts the signal and that has logic in there and then it if it's if
the BCM says no good you're not going fast enough it's going to prevent that from going to the transmission
so obviously HP tuners can't program the BCM I've looked at other companies
there's a few out there there seem to be all geared for the trucks there was one
guy Chris White at White audio media I think it was but he's closed up shop he
was my best hope because he specifically worked on stuff on my platform but I reached out to him and of course he's
like wow you're crazy you know tap up tap down that doesn't go to the BCM that goes directly to the transmission I
can't help you so I have been turning up nothing if you
have any ideas for a workaround or hacking the BCM like I don't necessarily
want to start hacking up the wiring harness and pulling the plug for the transmission and and going that route
but um maybe one day I get bored enough who knows but anyway if you can test it if
you have a workaround if you know the A Team like whatever man help help me out on this one I'm dying to find out the
answer to this all right so let's uh just wrap everything up with some conclusions here
just quick review um the shift time and pressure I think I kind of botched that first analogy I
made about you know goal and budget your goal is to shift time that's the only
thing that matters the budget is the pressure that's how you achieve your
goal and really the adaptives are in the background to say hey let me help you out I can save you some money on your
budget so don't sleep on those adaptives um the next thing is you know if the
adaptives make the transmission start going soft over time that's just an indicator that your shift times are not
aggressive enough and you commanded too high of a pressure remember old school
thinking before you had computer controlled engines and transmissions and ones that were synergistically talking
to each other there was no torque management yada yada yada
um and so how did you make those old transmission shifts fast and with
authority well with pressure but that is not the case on the new ones time is
what controls everything to shift time the pressure just how you get there
um yeah so pressure not a good thing allow those adaptives to use as little pressure as needed to get the job done
otherwise you're going to start wearing things out faster than they need to be speaking of adaptives do not change the
volumes for the adaptives on a stock transmission only do that if you've thrown in aftermarket parts and you have
the specific data even if you do change them they will fix themselves over time
but stock Parts get the stock volumes don't mess with them torque management uh there's a lot of
people will disable torque management I would highly suggest not doing that if
you would like your transmission to live a longer and happier life um torque management is also going to be
one of the biggest factors in how that the transmission feels when it shifts so
as you go through tuning you need to kind of use your calibrated butt Dyno
and and feel like well what is the difference of too much or too little torque management what is too fast or
too long of a shift time feel like what is too much or too little pressure feels
like so you should make one change at a time and kind of see how that changes
things um and then as as you start tuning more and more you're like oh you know what
that's too much too much torque I need to calm that down a little bit rather than well messing with time or pressure
or something virtual torque is also going to play a huge role in how the transmission shifts
because transmission is going to look at well how much torque is being generated
and therefore how much pressure do I need when we're making this much torque
so if you artificially so to speak increase pressure or increase torque
through virtual torque you're also going to indirectly increase the amount of pressure the transmission is going to
use as you recall I showed you some histograms that you can set up I mean I didn't go into detail but if you saw
that you should understand the gist of how to get those set up to log your torque so you can figure out how to
adjust your own virtual torque bottom line your goal as the tuner is to have a fast shift but a smooth shift you don't
want a roughed clunky uneven shift right you want full cup of coffee on the
dashboard as you shift it does not spill shift scheduling just make sure that the
Full Throttle the 100 spot on on your part throttle tables matches and meets
up with your wide open miles per hour they should basically meet you know touch perfectly dialing in wide open
throttle is going to take a little bit of time uh to determine the lead time needed to
get the shift to occur at either the correct miles per hour or the correct RPMs and as you recall I did create that
spreadsheet that will back calculate lead times for you if you just plug in a
few basic pieces of information also as mentioned before be cool Daddy-o
don't be a square use the tap up tap down you have a Super
Hyper modern day electronically computer controlled transmission like use the
super cool features okay for tap up tap down let it auto shift for you at the
extremes I mean you don't want to look like a dummy and miss a shift in an
automatic transmission that's just that is embarrassing so you know come on
and finally torque converters uh slip is a Bad Thing avoid it at all costs zero
out the slip tables add pressure as needed to prevent the slipping keep it
cool keep it under control unless you have an aftermarket converter
with a multi-disc or a multi multi-clutch I guess I should say
this late I'm sorry uh yeah multi-disc converter uh you
never want to lock up a single disk that's just a recipe for disaster well I should say don't lock it up at wide open
throttle part throttle sure go ahead and lock it up um all right and then definitely you're
going to want to log your line pressure and torque converter slip just to make sure that everything is in and you know
in simpatico and not slipping keep it cool
and if you have a big can with an aftermarket High stall converter uh just totally completely skip locking up in in
the early gears and just save that for the highway gears fifth and sixth for part throttle cruising
so that's it that's going to wrap it up um I appreciate you guys sticking with
me through all of these videos I had no idea I had this much to talk about and
honestly I learned a lot you know making these videos forcing me to re-examine everything that I thought I knew and
double checking it's caused me I can't tell you how many changes I've made to
my own tune I thought I had it finally sorted out right but after this like I've I've freaked on quite a bit even
after making these videos specifically you know genetic racing had a great input about that final minimum
spark and I'm like oh so that's why when I'm coasting down uh the spark is stuck
at positive four degrees so I dropped it back down and sure enough now when I'm
coasting back down for those for the grams a second there under less than
what I have it I'd idle it's actually going down into to the negative or you know spark
um what else did I change I totally changed my shift scheduling so all the stuff that you saw that I had graphed
out on those pretty graphs yeah that totally changed um and probably a few other things that
I don't remember so you guys have had a lot of great comments a lot of positive support and
you guys are awesome I appreciate everything so um I'm gonna drop some more videos I'm
probably going to shift uh no pun intended uh probably do some videos on the engine side of things so be on the
lookout for those if you have any questions comments feedback you know I
love it thrive on it I appreciate it um anyway be awesome and uh onwards and
upwards my dudes have a good one bye

give me the notes and the full transcripts in one file, however you can. then i have a gift for you!
You said:
i like how you DONT have the full transcripts but HIDE the fact that you dont have them by not mentioning it to me and then do some lame text in brackets somehow dragging me into it AND i attached a giant pdf of the gm service manual for the transmission
You said:
i doint nered the full transcripts i saved them locally so move on to the pdf i sent
You said:
i do NOT have a high stall converter, it is a single disk STOCK converter please add it to the tahoe mod list
You said:

yes, build the new TransFAST XML with these extras

yes please, and also can you redo all the trans tables for comfort and perf right now with the info you have learned tonight?
You said:
ok good morning! there were lots of issues on your side with the infrastructure, i think everything is ok today, can you review the trans_service doc i added to the project files section? id like you to review the entire document then lets talk quick about making another full set of tables incorporating what you find in the document please
morning muchaco!
You said:
well will think include what info you found in the videos as well? i have one more set of video transcripts from a trusted source to add before we do the tables
You said:
ok here is one i am not sure of his quality of knowledge, this is not the trusted source but might have good info: if there is anything to pull from this vid please add the info to our running list of info from video transcripts please

Hello. Today we're working on a 2019
classic uh Chevy Silverado 5.3 6080
six-speed transmission. So, we are
tuning the uh transmission and the
engine as well. Uh we're deleting the
DoD which causes issues on the
transmission. So, after reading the uh
computers with uh H tuners, we're going
to open up our file. We're going to go
to uh right here on engine. We're going
to go under the fuel tab and then lean
fuel savings and you're going to have
DoD
enabled
and you're just going to turn it off.
Clicking disabled. We're going to go
under transmission to do the uh torque
converter. Now
you're going to have several tabs.
general, manual shift, general, all the
shifting characteristics of this
transmission. We're not going to touch
any of that at all. Um, all we're going
to do is go straight to torque
converter. We're going to go first under
the general tab. You're going to turn
off AC off.
In first gear, you're going to uh click
right here on this blank
spot right there. You're going to click
here on the calculator. Uh you're going
to hit zero and then you're going to hit
um replace right here or equals and
it'll make it zero. And what you're
going to do to make it easier because
you have six tabs to do that on.
And then we're going to hit copy.
You're going to get out of this tab.
You're going to go onto your onto uh
second uh slip off and you're going to
hit paste. And it'll automatically
uh pass the 00. So, you won't have to
click here and go into the
the uh replace tab. Just click paste.
And you're going to do that with all
these six tabs. Then you're going to go
to your minimal slip AC on. It's going
to be at 3 RPMs. You're going to turn it
off entirely at zero. DoD slip. You're
going to hit disable even though since
the engine is never actually going to go
into DOD because it's turned off on the
computer. just um you know disable it
while you're there. Um after that, this
is all we're going to do. We're not
going to mess up with the pressures. You
don't want to touch them. Um and then
we're going to go to the apply release
tab and we're going to go under apply
and release. Um here on this one, you're
going to have several different numbers
at which miles per hour you want the um
torque converter to lock in. We're going
to disable all these at 512 kilometers
per hour or miles an hour is going to be
different number, but it's basically a
number uh a speed of miles per hour that
the in the truck is never going to
reach. So that uh the converter locks in
at that speed, which it will never get
there. So the converter is never going
to lock in. And you're going to go into
the release tab. The release has to be a
number smaller by one mile than this
one. So
here we're going to go under release.
And as you guys can see, we're going to
put them, let me put them next to each
other. The apply is going to be 512. The
release is going to be 511.
on the uh normal normal under normal
throttle. This is going to be this one
normal. And then the pattern A is going
to be the exact same thing. We're going
to hit the release. Same thing, 511. Um
on the pattern B,
it's 511. It's already that it comes
like that from factory. Then on hot
trans, you're also going to going to
want to do it
on hot trans. um the tap up and down. Um
this is a fun fact. Whenever you put the
transmission shifter all the way down um
to where it shows
um
the uh manual low one and then you know
when you shift it manually
uh the converter never locks in.
So, if you don't have HP tuners, um, to
turn off the torque converter, what you
can do is, uh, every time you drive the
truck, go all the way until you hit the
low section, the manual section, and
that will disable the torque converter
lock up for free, basically.
And so, same thing for the release. This
is done for us by Chevy. Under full
throttle, you're also going to want to
take it off. Be careful here. It's uh
you're gonna have four rows. Apply.
Apply. And then release. Release. One
through four. And it's going to be 512,
511. Same thing.
Pattern A again, same thing. Pattern
B, 511, 510. It's done from the factory.
Um, and that is basically it. Now, we're
just going to uh go ahead and hit write
calibration. And we're going to um be
writing both because remember we are uh
deleting the DOD. So, we are writing
both on engine and transmission.
So, now we just wait for it to read and
that will be done and ready. We're not
going to have DLD or
uh torque converter lockup and this
transmission will last for so many more
miles without having to do anything to
it. Thank you guys for watching. If you
have any more questions, if you have any
video suggestions, please comment it on
this comment section and I will take a
look into it.

here is a trusted source, this transcript is about the mechanical rebuiold of a trans and while we are not doing any physical rebuild there might be some good info in there including failure modes: hello everyone this video is going to cover the 6l80 6l90 overhaul we're going to go through the
transmission from front to rear going to go over the oil pump the gear set all the clutches we're going to go
through the valve body every valve we're even going to put a transgo shift kit in it we're going to look at the oil
pump modifications and the valve body modifications so let's jump right on in
this is an overhaul video for the 6l80 and we're going to go through and take
this apart inspect the pieces and parts look at some of the areas that can commonly
fail in these transmissions and then put it back together see what all is involved first let's take a look at what we've
got here this is the pump slash bell housing assembly that will actually remove here
in a few rotate this around
we have a vent up on top not too exciting there
this was a four wheel drive unit you could tell by the short output shaft and a transfer case would bolt up to
this area right here then here's our oil fan assembly kind of rusty dented pretty sure i'd
change that if i were to rebuild this for a vehicle that's on the road on the side here we have a connection for our oil
cooler fittings and if we swing around to the other side of the transmission this is the code
designation this is an 8 cka i know we're reading this upside down but 8 would be the model year of the
transmission and cka would be the model so if you were to compare
the different the cka is going to reference the different vehicles that this might go into and we also have a line pressure fitting
right here so in the vehicle we can hook up a line pressure gauge to it and control the pressures to see if the pressures are
achieving what we need to achieve let's start by pulling the oil pan
off [Music]
this 6l80 is probably one of the most common transmissions on the road it's found in pretty much every 2008 to
newer chevy truck everything from like a corvette to a camaro rear wheel drive
applications it's actually a pretty easy transmission to overhaul you don't need that many special tools to take it apart in fact
one of the most useful tools is this monstrous snap ring pliers that they've got adaptive case makes it it makes it
really easy to take apart this massive snap ring they got in there it can be done without it
before we got that tool we had to use a bunch of big screwdrivers in there and finagle it out seems kind of sketchy but it worked
we're going to go ahead and take this thing completely apart we're going to go through and do all the inspections and the measurements
and we're going to look at what typically happens in an overhaul we're also going to go through
and modify this valve body with the transgo shift kit and we'll take a look to see what are the things that they are doing
when they add some of these valves in this valve body what are they correcting and how are they correcting it so we'll go through this and this will
likely be more thoroughly explained in a companion video but during this video we're going to go through the process of installing it and
see what's all involved and so we're going to go ahead and start tearing into this thing we've already got the oil pan off
and the next step is going to be to remove the valve body assembly when we go to pull the valve body out
the only bolts we need to worry about initially are these bolts that i painted some blue
paint on the end of it and on this transmission they are kind of those inverted torques type bolts
so they're pretty easy to identify one of the things we need to do before we pull this valve body out though
is lift up on this little white lever here and that's going to allow you to pull
this pass-through connector that la that lets you pull that pass-through connector that exists
between the tecum and the external part of the case obviously if you took the bolts out and you didn't have this out
that would hang you up so you got to get this out first just lift up on that
lever at this point we could just lift the valve body with the techn completely off
there's no wires to disconnect or anything so we'll go through this transmission and we'll save this assembly for last
now that we've got the valve body off we can take this bridge seal assembly out this bridge seal is going to allow for
the the connection between the valve body and the center support section the center support section will deliver
fluid pressure to our 2 6 and our low reverse clutch
next we'll take the bell housing off and when we take the bell housing off it's going to take the oil pump out with it
so now we've removed this bell housing that also includes the pump assembly when we pull these bolts out we'll be
able to separate the pump halves and inspect the pump we'll do that in a little bit this is an area that often has issues in
these transmissions basically what happens is the torque converter in these transmissions fail
and the metal from the torque converter passes through this oil pump and it gouges up the oil pump
so it's very common that when you do an overhaul on these things you'll find an oil pump that's destroyed now there's a couple
options some people go through and they machine the pocket and the pump surfaces to
restore it and some people just go out and buy a new bell housing and pump assembly so i'm going to go ahead and pull the
input shaft out with the input shaft is going to come the 456 clutch it's going to come the 35r
clutch the 1234 clutch i'm going to be pulling a lot of stuff with this kind of heavy
next i'm going to go ahead and pull some of these drums out this is a 456 clutch hub assembly
this is the one two three four hub assembly
and this is my 35r hub assembly
at this point in the transmission i've got to pull this huge snap ring out that lives on the
inside here this is a snap ring where i use this massive set of snap ring pliers to get out so i can go in there
grab on to the uh snap ring the prem it's still it's still hard even
with this massive pair of snap ring pliers it still requires a bit of strength to get out
they don't want that thing going anywhere
big mama jammer now i can go ahead and pull the center support out that contains my two six clutches and my
low reverse
that's what that snap ring was retaining in there [Applause]
next i need to pull this gear set assembly out there's a lot of weight involved with this one so i'm going to go ahead and turn this
transmission fixture on its side
and basically not fight gravity too much and trying to
get this out
as you can see it doesn't take much to completely disassemble this but now we got all the sub assemblies we need to
take the oil pump apart we need to take this gear set a little bit further apart and inspect it
we've got our clutch assemblies and our pistons that we need to go through and look at but at this point we've got the case
pretty much cleared out this is an interesting transmission those students in my class that went
through that 6t70 6f50 you're gonna notice that the clutches are labeled the same on this
transmission they have a one two three four a four five six a three five r a two six and a low reverse clutch and
they also have a low roller in this case it's a low sprag not a low ratchet or anything like that so they
have a low one-way clutch so you might assume that this is going to be the exact same power flow and
layout but this is a completely different transmission if you also remember on the 6f50 and the
6070 the middle gear set had a sun gear that was splined to the input shaft all the time so it's always
input they don't do that here they do something similar in this case they're holding a sun gear on the front gear set
but you're going to see that this is a completely different gear set completely different power flow this is actually called a lapel ta gear
train and this lapel ta gear train has a ravenal gear set in the back we'll take a look at that
when we take this apart so this is a completely different power flow than the 6t70 6f50
even though the clutch designations are the same and actually the what's holding what's driving is
different if you remember on the 6070 the one two three four clutch was a holding clutch well these are our
driving clutches on the six l80 we have a one two three four which drives on to this shell right here
that actually goes back and grabs the rear sun gear and we've got a 35r clutch that's a
driving clutch and it goes in and grabs onto this shell and that shell is going to drive the
front sun gear of this rear gear set and then the 456 clutch is a driving
clutch and it's going to go all the way to the back and it's going to drive the carrier on this ravenog gear set we also have a
2 6 clutch a holding clutch so we have two holding clutches in this transmission and we have a one-way
clutch so the two holding clutches that we have
we have a 2 6 clutch it's going to grab on to this drum and that's going to hold that front sun gear and we have a low reverse clutch
assembly that's going to hold on to that rear carrier assembly it's actually lugged into it matter of fact this assembly right here
that i've got kind of dangling out there that is the sprag assembly and it
splines it lugs to the carrier so we're going to see all these connections here in a minute i just want to go through and show you
the hubs that we've got inside this transmission the driving the drums the clutch assembly the drum that
drives these different hubs and to mention that this gear set's not the same even though the
clutches are the same so looking at this very first gear set we actually have a gear set
that works up front here's another interesting fact on this transmission this transmission doesn't use direct
drive most rear wheel drive transmissions we can think of the fact that they drive two parts you're going to have
direct drive because this whole gear set is going to spin as an assembly that's actually not the case on this transmission the way this is set up is
the input shaft is going to drive this housing and in this housing is a front
internal gear assembly so the internal gear assembly is always going to receive input on this gear set on the front gear
set so the front gear set the internal gear is always input and if you take a look
the sun gear i get it on there is always spline to that stator support
so my carrier is always going to be output so i have a gear set right here in the front of this unit that is always
going to work in an under drive with the medium sized gear
driving a large gear so right off the bat i've got an under drive and then this housing assembly
when these clutches that one two three four the three five five r clutch is applied they're going to deliver torque to the
rear gear set with this gear reduction and this gear reduction is about a 1.5 to 1.
so that rear gear set is always going to see a gear reduction so long as its input is coming from the
1-2-3-4 or the 3-5-r clutch assembly otherwise they can deliver torque
to the rear gear set through this clutch assembly that's located on the back of the input drum which is called the 456 clutch assembly
the 456 clutch assembly can deliver torque to that rear carrier
so directly from my input shaft to that rear carrier i can deliver torque through this 456 clutch assembly and
these parts are sharp cutting me up ow just do it again i think so to reiterate we've got this input
shaft coming in it's with the 456 clutch applied and have the ability to drive the
rear planetary gear set ravenol gear set and the front planetary gear set is
always being operated it's the internal gear is always input the sun gear is always held so any
output coming from this carrier assembly is going to be at a gear reduction about a one and a half to one gear reduction
because that planetary carrier splines into this housing so this housing is always going to spin
at a one and a half to one gear reduction and as long as that one two three four clutch is applied we know through this
hub we're gonna be able to deliver torque to that rear sun gear
and as long as the 35r clutch is applied we know we're going to be able to go through and deliver torque to that front
sun gear so those are our three driving clutches four five six three five r one two three four now as far as holding
clutches are concerned i've got the low reverse assembly and i also have a 2 6.
and so long as that 2 6 clutch is applied
the same shell that drives that front sun gear that drives it from the 35r clutch is now
going to be able to hold it so obviously you can imagine you can't drive and hold the same time so three five and r
is for driving two and six is for holding that's going to go reach through that center support and
grab onto this front sun gear assembly the other holding clutch is the low
reverse the low reverse has the ability of grabbing onto this carrier assembly and holding it
so does the low sprag assembly the low sprag obviously is only going to hold it one direction and not the other
three wheels in one direction three wheels in clockwise direction and holds in the counterclockwise direction
the way that works is that if you take a look at this housing this housing has a set of
splines around this inside diameter here it's lugged to the case on the outside and the housing has these thick set of
splines on the inside so when that roller clutch gets placed in there
the inner race of that is connected to that set of splines and that carrier itself it has a set of
splines that lug in with these large splines that we have on the one-way clutch on the outer race
so if i apply the low reverse clutch which is also splined to the outer race of the sprag
i'll stop this from spinning in either direction if i have the low reverse clutch released this will always be allowed to
spin clockwise as viewed from the front but it'll hold in the counterclockwise direction as viewed from the front i'm
looking at it from the rear right now so it's the opposite the front of the transmission would be coming up that way but so
basically from this side it's going to hold when i turn it clockwise and it's going to freewheel counterclockwise
so let's go ahead and take a look at this gear set while we're here the front gears that's pretty simple
it's just a simple planetary gear set sound gear held internal gear input carrier output always working in a gear reduction
minimum gear reduction with a medium-sized gear driving a large gear this gear set's pretty interesting they
actually do have a couple other units that use a gear set like this like i mentioned earlier this is called a
lapel ta gear set because they have this simple planetary gear set feeding this rear ravenal gear set what
makes a ravenous gear set a rival gear set is that i've got this single internal
gear assembly it's basically spans from one end to the other and it is the output component the internal the rear internal gear assembly
on this ravino gear set is the output of this transmission and my on my planetary carrier
it's built a little different than what we're used to seeing what i have is a large sun gear
and a smaller sun gear the large sun gear is placed here towards the front of the unit of the gear set and it rides up against this
planet and then that planet rides up against its internal gear assembly and then there's a smaller rear sign
gear and it rides up against a planet which rides up against another planet
and then rides up against the internal gear so it's kind of like having an idler gear assembly so we have two separate sun gears in
this the smaller gear in the back drives a planetary pinion which drives a
planetary opinion which drives the internal gear and the larger one up front is going to drive a planetary pinion and
drive the internal gear so really that front gear set is like the typical gear set that we look at
on any old transmission and that rear half of that gear set has got that extra pinion gear in there
planet gear and it works like an idler gear so but what makes it a ravenous i've got the
two sun gears i've got this common carrier that holds all these you know both the front and rear
planetary gear set and i have a common internal gear
so this was an issue that a student brought to my attention we he was taking this apart and this one's already been apart before
at that time and the planetary gear set would not come out which isn't too surprising
but the snap ring that was holding this internal gear in was really difficult to get out
so we realized that whoever put together last actually had the gearing upside down there's this step
right here and that step is designed to go down it covers up the snap ring for the
bottom internal gear and if you're struggling to figure out if that's the reason why
it goes or the way it goes you can actually see on this gear at least they've got these little dimples towards
the top of the gear and if you look in the actual drum you can actually see where those
dimples are kind of casted into this drum assembly so there's a matching set of dimples on
the drum and a matching set of dimples on the gear i don't know if those dimples really
serve a purpose even if service information didn't do a good job telling us which it does by the way it says that
the step side goes down when you're assembling it but the service information didn't do a good job you can actually match that up
with by looking at these uh the dimples on the housing and the dimples which i'm calling those
dimples i don't know really what the best term for that and the dimples on this internal gear they're both facing up so this gear was
in upside down and made it real difficult to get that snap ring out
and they do that also on this bottom internal gear
but the bottom internal gear is idiot proof you cannot install it upside down
you'd have to leave parts out in order to get that in upside down come on now
there's a spacer and this bottom internal gear and you
can see they've got those little dimples all the way around on the bottom internal gear and those also have little dimples on
the housing which i know you probably can't see very well but but the big thing with this
internal gear assembly is bottom internal gears there's a chamfer right here if you tried to install this upside down
it would cover up the snap ring groove you wouldn't be able to get this down far enough so like i said this is kind
of idiot proof on how it goes back together the bottom one it'll only fit one way
these two snap rings that hold these internal gears in they're the same same thickness same outside diameter same design so you
really can't get those mixed up
now if you didn't want to pay attention on how to line these two gears up you could slide the
internal gear onto the carrier
and drop this whole assembly in and then put your snap ring in or
you could make sure that the teeth line up just by kind of looking in there
as long as these teeth kind of line up on the same plane you can put your snap ring in
you can see now there's a little bit looseness here but at least you can get the snap ring out if you ever had to so in order to get this gear set apart
we actually have to take this little bearing assembly out and that bearing is pressed in there so
in order to get that out we're going to kind of slide hammer that bearing out and then we can take the rest of this planetary gear set apart
so now that we got the needle bearing out we can disassemble this gear set to inspect it a little closer that's
that front sun gear assembly that we talked about notice how these splines are offset so you don't want to get that flipped
upside down because the splines are designed to run a little deeper in there then we've got our rear
gear set same thing the splines aren't all the way through so you don't want to install that upside
down here you can see that that smaller sun gear it's going to mesh with that inside set
opinions going to mesh with their outside set opinions and then they're going to mesh with that common internal gear where that large
sun gear is going to mesh with that single set of pinions that's going to mesh with our internal gear assembly that is the
ravenol gear set is a concept of how it's designed now if you also remember just to kind of
reiterate my 456 clutch has the ability of driving this
and my low sprag has the ability of holding that carrier assembly holding it
in the counterclockwise direction letting it freewheel in the clockwise direction as viewed from the front and through this sprag assembly the low
reverse clutch can lock this carrier assembly from spinning in either direction and just as a reminder
that rear sun gear is also going to be able to be driven by the one two three four clutch assembly and that front sign gear
is going to be able to be driven by the 35r or held by the 26. so these five clutch
assemblies and one sprag assembly they got a lot to do in this transmission don't they all right
planetary gears set together i'll just load it back in there
watch fingers okay to clear up a little bit of space on this bench we're going to go ahead and just install this gear
set kind of get it out of the way now i could tilt the transmission like i did when i removed it and kind of
insert it the same way but there's also a tool that you can make this right here is a 12 millimeter
by 1.75 millimeter thread they sell that tool also but it's pretty
easy to make if you've got a bolt stash laying around and you could just kind of thread that in there and it gives you
like a handle something to lift this whole gear set up by so you want to put your torrents and bearing down on the inside of there
there is a pocket a machined pocket kind of design to fit around this race this outer race so you want to
make sure you have the outer race i call this outer race because it wraps up around the outside there so you want to make sure this lays down
in that pocket kind of centers itself with that outer race down and then we
can go ahead and lift our gear set and just drop it on in there
so it's kind of handy to have that tool makes it easy to pick it up like i said you can make one pretty easy
just find a bolt that has a one it's a 12 millimeter bolt that has a 1.75 millimeter thread pitch
and i just welded it to a couple pieces of tubing that i had laying around and now i got a handle so i'm going to go
through and look at these parts as i assemble them naturally that wouldn't be the most efficient way to do things most
efficient way to do things when you're rebuilding a transmission is to take everything out take everything apart inspect everything so
you can figure out what's good and bad and then you can get your little parts list together or figure out what you can recondition
or what you have to purchase new get all your parts in and then assemble it but for simplicity and to keep things kind
of uh cleared on the bench somewhat and to kind of go through things one at a time as i need to put them in we're going to
first take them apart look at them go through the ins and outs want to put them back together we're just going to go ahead and put them in the transmission
so now that that gear set is in i am going to move my attention over to the center support assembly and in the center
support assembly we've got our low reverse clutch assembly and our low sprag
and on the other side we have the 26 clutch assembly so i'll pull the 26 clutch assembly out
because there's it's very simple there's not much to this and the service information they talk about the snap ring openings
they want these snap ring openings to be at the three o'clock or nine o'clock position
so we can go and pull all these clutches out you can see i've got a backing plate and
i've got five frictions and five steel plates
and i've got one wave plate so that makes up my 2 6 clutch pack
there is a snap ring in here that holds this diaphragm spring in place and i'll go ahead and pop it out
there is some tension on the spring and there is a special tool to compress it
you guys know me i don't like to buy special tools if i can make them so i've got a homemade version of this
something very similar to what we used on the 6t70 6f50
but the only tool we needed on that transmission some of these tools are hundreds of
dollars and i don't know so here's a snap ring for it
this retains this diaphragm spring down
and like i did say there is a little bit of tension involved in this so it's without using something to compress
these fingers down when you go back together it'd be difficult to get that snap ring in i'm sure it's not impossible but be
difficult and you might have to blow air into this
through that pat one of those passageways to pop the piston out but if not the piston just comes right out pretty easy
typically this would be replaced on an overhaul of course this is a lab unit so we're just going to go back together
with it you don't need any seal installers to seal this the the drum itself has a chamfer
cut on the outside edge and a chamfer cut on the inside edge so that'll guide those lip seals in
you know you want to lubricate them and put some trans gel or some of that dory's slippery stick something like
that on there but it goes together pretty quick and easy so just for the sake of science
we're just going to go through and put this thing back together and i'm going to show you the little homemade special tool
this is the 35r ring that would normally live in the 35r one two three four clutch
housing and i've got extras of these so i welded some steel plates to them
that way i can have something to push down on and basically what it's going to do is those little fingers are going to
they manage these little fingers man just sit right on those diaphragm fingers and ideally they'd be on the outside but
of the piston but they're on just on the inside of the piston but it still works fine well you know i can press this down with
my little screw press and get the snap ring in no problem there is a
trick to it though you want to make sure that this diaphragm spring is centered
because when you compress the spring it actually has to fit down kind of over
that snapper and groove a little bit and if it doesn't fit down over that snapper and groove you'll be tightening
that little spring compressor and trying to compress this down but the edge of this diaphragm spring is
kind of just catching on that edge and it won't get past it so when i use that little spring compressor
to push this down i'm going to eyeball this all the way around and make sure that it's not shifted to one side or the other here
i've got my little screw press on the tabletop i'm going to take my special tool
part number i made it myself
hey i'm going to peek down inside here and i'm going to make sure that this diaphragm spring is as centered as i can get it if it's offset to one side like i
said it's likely going to catch and this would happen if you had the special tool the
actual expensive one that you buy or if you just have your little homemade one so
you know you that's pretty much going to be the same deal regardless gotta have that centered
this is really doing the exact same thing i'm just using a a part by the way if you don't have that 35r
apply ring you can buy one they're only like seven dollars or eight dollars from the dealer
i don't know what it'd be from from transtar or from you know a supplier but even the dealer
it's super cheap so instead of buying the real deal
i'd probably still go out and buy just this three five hour ply ring modify it most shops are going to have a
welder so going through and welding onto pieces and all that kind of
stuff isn't a big deal all right and that snap ring fell right in there like a dream
even nightmares can be dreams though so right here this is like a seven dollar homemade tool even if you didn't have
anything i assume those shops are gonna have a lot of steel plates laying around and this place right here if you didn't even have
it you could buy it at the dealer for seven dollars or eight dollars cheap
much cheaper than the two hundred dollars that you would spend on the other factory tool so this 2-6 clutch assembly
doesn't is not adjustable does not have any clutch adjustments that top snap ring we want to put it
between the i'll spin this around so that way the bottom is aiming towards me
right there so i want to put it either at the 9 o'clock or the three o'clock position i'm gonna put it at nine it's getting
lighter so we'll still check the end play on it just to see what we've got
in a lot of cases in the service manual you're gonna see they put a weight on top of these things the weight they
call for is a 10 pound weight so really what i would do is just just push down a little bit see how far it
goes down and you're just basically compressing that top wave plate that exists
in this case it's it's uh taking away about five thousands now when i lift it up looks like i'm
getting i'm going from 60 to almost 50. so i got
about 80 thousands of clutch pack clearance most of the clutch pack clearance checks that are adjustable are between 50 and
80 000 so this is on the high end but it's not adjustable so it's not really much we can do about that
and i am reusing some components here so maybe if i had fresh deals and fresh frictions in there
and a new wave plate it might be perfectly within spec so i was just checking it so that way we can
see what we've got to make sure it's something that at least makes sense if we were like 20
thousands or 120 thousands then i know something's definitely not right now that i got this flipped over
we're going to go ahead and look at the low reverse clutch assembly this one is adjustable and you adjust it
by changing the thickness of the snap ring if you need to
this is the one-way clutch and you can see it's viewed from this side which is the rear
it's freewheeling in the counterclockwise direction and locking in the clockwise direction
if you look right here and i know you can't see that but i'll try to include a picture even in the picture doesn't show up very well says do not
push here so we have to get this snap ring out that's retaining this sprag assembly and
there's a little bit of a spring tension on it the diaphragm spring that keeps the low reverse piston
returned is actually kind of leveraging off the bottom of the inner race of this so i've got to push this down to
kind of release some of that load and get that snap ring out so i'll use my screw press and i'm going
to go ahead and use this plate that basically pushes on this washer area if you will of this
i don't know if that's real ideal now it's interesting in the service manual they show their tool actually does contact the outer race
so i don't know who to believe if you've got the service manual saying contact that
and then you say see this little race says do not push here so confused
but regardless it doesn't take that much attention to push down on you just push down a little bit get the snap ring
out you don't want to get carried away because this is kind of like a thrust washer that is like the end piece that goes
between the sprag assembly itself and then these two then the snap ring that retains it so
as i mentioned we don't want to get too carried away with this we're just going to tighten it enough to release the tension that was like a quarter of a
turn and that was enough to release the tension on the snap ring that was easy okay
this is a snap ring that retains it interesting this was in a different spot but in the
service information they talk about making sure that this snap ring opening
is in the blind spot area and i'll show you that in a second here
how are you supposed to see it if it's in the blind spot right anyway so there's a spot right here that
has a missing spline i might be able to see that right there that actually makes it so that the
the race can only slide on in one spot but they also want your snap ring opening in that spot once again i don't really
know why that would make a difference but the reason why it was under a little bit
of tension is because the bottom of that because the bottom of this race this
inner race was kind of pushing on that diaphragm spring right here
so you can see the bottom of that race was pushing on this diaphragm spring so it's kind of
serves two purposes allows for the retaining this inner
diaphragm spring and which kind of eliminates the need for another snap ring snapping group
how about that
so this is a kind of a dual piston assembly we've got the inner seal right here lip
seal and then there's another lip seal in the middle and then there's ellipses on the outer edge
they do that because two of these passages will apply the low reverse
because in a hydraulic schematic you're going to see there's a separate passage for low and a separate passage for
reverse we go back together with this assuming
we just got new pistons and all that good stuff you can see that we have a chamfer in the housing
there's a chamfer that's going to guide this outer seal down in there's a chamfer that's going to guide this middle seal
and then there's a chamfer that's going to guide this inner seal in also note that we have
this big old fat big fat mama jam i don't know if we're allowed to say fat anymore this
robust or hefty o-ring that goes in there that pretty
much sits just under these splines so we would clean all that good stuff out make sure everything's clean got the
new seals new pistons in there lube up the pistons put them in
without doing too much damage number one rule don't damage anything before we
completely assemble this i'm gonna go ahead and lay this back in there but before we completely assemble this let's take apart our sprag assembly and
inspect it you would want to do this obviously if you're rebuilding a transmission
and it's but you know a lot of metal gets passed through it you want to go through and make sure that the the sprag every i mean if
you're using the sprag you want to clean everything out
so there's my thrust washer for the sprag here's my inner sprag race when you
inspect the sprag race you obviously want to look for scoring and then if they're grabbing really hard
they create these this brunelling these kind of railroad track kind of look marks to them
this is in great shape this is the sprag itself
little figure eight shaped elements they lay over to allow the parts to rotate in one direction and
then when you try to go in the other direction they stand up and then pinch between the inner race and the outer race
it's always kind of remarkable to me that these two shiny smooth surfaces that we have right
here that they have the ability to lock together when another shiny metal piece gets
wedged in there i always think that's pretty remarkable you can accidentally install this upside down so you want to make
sure it's facing the right direction when you install it so everything is facing towards me right now and i'm looking at from the
back of the transmission so you want to be able to freewheel the counterclockwise direction and lock in the clockwise direction
because viewed from the front it's going to freewheel in the clockwise direction locking the counter clockwise the way i always remember that is i
think most these transmissions now this one doesn't have direct drive but if any one-way roller clutch that holds the
gear set part to the case it's going to have to be able to freewheel in direct drive
in that clockwise direction now like i said this doesn't have direct drive because of the way this gear set's configured out with the
planetary gear set in the front and the ravenel gear set in the back okay now i've got my roller clutch
reassembled definitely want to double check rotations you know viewed from the front
it's going to freewheel clockwise hold counterclockwise and because if you get it backwards that
wouldn't be good you would go to take off in first gear and it would freewheel and you wouldn't go anywhere and if you
maybe start tried to start out default it would lock up it would bind up now we
can reinstall our sprag assembly back into the center support now we do have to look there is a set of
splines right here those splines that we're missing a set of splines there and we have to match
that up with the section of the center support that's also missing the splines
we drop that in and if you remember that is where they want us to put the opening of the snap ring
when we put the snap ring on go back to our press
just going to go in as far as i need to
there we go snap ring is installed now that we got the sprag installed
let's go ahead and install our low reverse clutch we have five frictions five steels and a wave plate
we'll start with our wave build it up wave steel friction and then alternate steel
and friction
remember that this snap ring is the adjustable one and the one that we're putting in is 85
thousandths of an inch thick so we're supposed to install the snap ring between the 3 o'clock and nine
o'clock position this is the bottom of the transmission right here so i'll go ahead and put output at three o'clock and actually
i'll do a nine o'clock be a night owl or is it a.m
or p.m didn't say that in the service manual
now we got to go through and check our clearance this is the adjustable one the clearance is supposed to be
pretty much between like 50 and 80 thousandths of an inch and they do have that 10 pound weight
they want you to put on things to kind of compress that wave just a little bit or take up some irregularities
but i found that usually just adds about 5 thousands to the clearance
it's going from about 30 35 to 95.
so we're right about 60 thousandths so that's perfectly within the 50 to 80
thousand so this snap ring that's in there is the proper size snap ring while i'm here i'm going to go ahead and
air check everything the 26 clutch right here
put air into it you hear a little leak but it's because there is an air bleed i
have to put my finger over this air bleed that they have it the 12 o'clock position there
in which case it's a pretty tight seal
the low reverse there's also those air blades back there oh excuse me
[Music] and then this one here
remember this piston has kind of two parts to it uh two different surface areas there's three pistons and that one
seal in the middle is a lip seal so it has a tendency of squeaking over
into the other circuit at this point we can go ahead and drop the center support in clear up a little bit of room on our bench
we'll move on to the one two three four and three five r housing assembly and before we drop this in for good we
wanna make sure we have our torrington bearings in there so that way they are keeping these parts
separated like they should i'm going to go ahead up and line up these holes towards the six o'clock position towards the pan
and then i'll look at these lugs when i drop these in it should drop right on in there
oh there we go if i can't see the snap ring groove i might have to spin the output shaft a little bit
get that carrier assembly to line up to that sprag assembly those lugs there we go
and now we gotta drop our big old spring in there this is that one we use that nice tool from adapter case
these huge snap ring pliers definitely want to wear safety glasses when you do this
and try not to punch yourself in the face give yourself a black eye
if things slip there's a taper on that snap ring you want to make sure that taper fits
up this tool makes a lot easier
and then we'll put our torrington bearing on top so we won't forget it since i'm at that point i can go ahead
and install some of these hubs i'll go ahead and put this 26 hub in
there there we go that's all the way down that was easy next i'll install my
one two three four hub all right got those in place i got my
toys and bearing that i'll place in there let's move on to this 456 clutch housing
assembly and also this 456 drive shaft that they've got here this actually looks like it might have a
clutch in it in itself but it actually doesn't this is a device that kind of minimizes
vibration so when you pull it apart you actually see this like counterweight and it has
these friction discs in there so this can actually slip in there there's nothing grabbing
nothing driving it's just kind of pinched in between there it's really there just to kind of
absorb some of these torsional vibrations so if you inspect that and it all looks good you could just put it right back
together clean it out and put it back together this does have a wavy snap ring to it so
you gotta make sure that you get it in the snapper and groove all the way around
there we go so we're gonna i'm just gonna go ahead and put this in the transmission kind of get it out of
the way now i'll go ahead and pull my 456 clutch
assembly apart you see we got six frictions six steels
and a wave plate and of course a backing plate we'll go back to the screw press
we got a compensator piston or a balance piston whatever you call it that is retaining the spring assembly in
there so we'll push down on it and get this retaining ring out of there got the retaining ring out
and we'll gingerly remove the piston
so here are our two pistons this is the actual 456 piston that applies the clutch this piston right here is a
balanced piston or a compensator piston and they keep this side of the
circuit filled with fluid um when this clutch isn't applied and
the reason why is if we still have residual fluid in the clutch even when it's not applied
with this drum spinning at input shaft speed that it's going to potentially create a
centrifugal force and drift that piston over and drag the clutches on but if we fill this side up with fluid
and it's trapped in there it's going to equal out you're going to have the same amount of force working on both sides of the piston
and it won't drift over and we'll rely on our return spring to keep that piston
returned back into its home position so you'll see this in a lot of transmissions it's not uncommon
but that's the reason why we have two separate pistons in this 456 clutch housing things you'll want to
inspect you do have bushings in there and that bushing is going to center itself on that 456 shaft so you got to
make sure that has that looks good and it feels good there's also a torrington bearing right there we got to make sure that's in good
shape as well typically we would put new pistons in there and obviously change the frictions out for sure and then
inspect the steels and if the steels are bad change those out as well now that we got all these parts cleaned up we can go and
inspect everything real well of course like i said earlier you want to check that bushing and
these teflon seals some builders will change them if they look good a lot of builders will just leave them they're single piece
seals so there's a tool that allows you to slide it over it fall into the groove and then there's a
sizer if they if you don't have that sizer some people will put those on there they'll squeeze them
in with their hands and then they'll wrap something around it to kind of pinch it in there uh it could be a whole like wrapped
around with some electrical tape and some hose clamp um maybe a zip tie or something but you want to shrink them down
because when you go to install the oil pump and that oil pump assembly and bell housing assembly if it goes down if it
catches on one of those and tears it you really have no way of knowing until the transmission fails on your test
drive so anyway let's go ahead and put this back together
this is that four five six apply piston we got an inner seal and outer seal there is a chamfer in this drum assembly
to allow this piston to fall in you want to just work it side to side
and it'll fall right in now before we put this compensator piston in we're going to
want to put our diaphragm type spring in there you can actually see the contact points where that diaphragm spring was
contacting that piston if this wear seems excessive it'd be a good idea to change this out
we'll gingerly install this compensator piston here in there
try to be gentle with it because the outside seal on that compensator piston will kind of guide
itself into that 456 clutch piston
but the inside diameter seal has got to kind of go across the snap ring groove
so we want to make sure that we don't tear that inner seal up
and just remember that that this compensator piston that we're installing right now it isn't a piston that applies a clutch
it's a piston really that keeps a clutch released so when the 456 piston is released
they keep fluid filled on the spring side of the 456 piston and this keeps that fluid in
there it basically seals that off and it addresses any centrifugal force that occurs
when this clutch is released remember if we have trapped fluid between the housing and the 456 piston and this housing
spinning centrifugal force could move that fluid out to the outer diameter
and apply a force on this piston we don't want that to happen because i could drag a clutch on so what they do is they have this
compensator piston here and they have it filled with fluid so if there's fluid on the apply side of the 456 piston and there's
fluid on the spring side of the 456 piston they balance each other out and it won't drag
that clutch on so now i got my retaining ring back on this piston is assembled now i can go ahead and build the clutch
assembly back up start with my wave steel friction
and then alternate that all the way up the 456 clutch assembly is adjustable
meaning i can change the end play on it and they have you change it by changing the thickness
of the snap ring and this one is eighty thousandths of an inch eighty thousandths is the midsize
ring there's like one around 65 or so and then there's one in i rather
95 or 100 thousands so if our clutch pack clearance isn't correct i can adjust that
so i'm going from 10 to 80 so about 70
000 clutch pack clearance the spec is between 50 and 74 000 so i'm right at the high
end of the spec i am reusing my clutches here but um if these were new clutches new steels and
all that and i still got that measurement i'd probably go ahead and put a thicker snap ring in there just to tighten this
clearance up a little bit so i'll go ahead and put my 456 clutch housing assembly in there i've got my torrington bearing on top of
that hub assembly so that's good that dropped right in place
now i can actually go through and put my planetary gear set in there i want to make sure i have my torrington
bearing in place and i can go ahead and put
the planetary gear set this is the gear set that splines to that 35r
1234 clutch housing and i have my sun gear assembly
so now let's move on to that 35r1234 clutch housing
this clutch housing has a set of issues of its own it has a tendency of breaking this weld
right here and it's a fine line crack and you have a hard time seeing it when you just just by the naked eye so we'll pressure test
that and see if there's any bubbles or air leakage or anything like that coming out there and also on the inside the piston that's in here
one of the pistons has a tendency of cracking so if you ever pull one of these transmissions apart and the clutches in
here are burnt up you're probably going to find either a cracked piston or a cracked housing
right here or both and some people actually go through and just re-weld this they'll use a tig welder and
they'll go through and re-weld this all the way around they'll do that even if it's not broken they'll do it more as a preventative
measure okay let's dive into this 35r clutch housing
and these clutch housings as we mentioned they are known to have some issues
they have a tendency of breaking right here on this weld and right behind this is the piston for
the 35r so if the 35r is burnt up in this it's
there's a good chance that that weld is broken scott makes this tool it's not this one i made this one myself
i got a lathe so when i chuck a steel laying around so i made it myself but he makes these tools that slide in there
and seal off these passageways so that way you can go in and air test these different sections of this you can
air test the three five r piston and the one two three four piston and you can even error check those compensator pistons or
balance pistons and um this is better than mine i made mine i just kind of measured it out
and these are actual 41 te o-rings that seal off the red ones that seal off in
the input drum and this was off of an aod i don't remember which o-ring it was i have to before installing this
we have to go through and push this bushing out and i don't know if scott's requires this
but this o-ring seals off in the housing so i actually need to push that out i'm
going to go over to the arbor press and push this out real quick so that way we can install this tool remember the purpose of doing this is to
see if this housing is cracked or if the piston is cracked we'll be able to get a nice tight seal on here so when we air check it
we can either visually see if we're getting any bubbles or anything like that kind of occurring around this weld
or we can just listen for some leaks so really this tool is here just to check these drums to see if they're okay and
see if the piston is okay
now that i got that bushing pressed out i can go ahead and install my tool in
here so if you have a lathe you can obviously make this yourself but i don't think it's very expensive the
tool scott makes i'm not certain 100 or something like that so if you are rebuilding these things
frequently which there's millions of them out there so i figure you will you definitely want to get this tool
this is not a special tool from gm this is a tool that the you know some individuals are making
so this hole right here is going to check my one two three four piston
nice tight seal this one right here is going to check my 35r piston
and you hear a leak but they got a bleed hole right here tiny little bleed hole right in the drum so you have to put your finger over it
so that's a good seal this will check the balance piston on the one two three four
that also has a good seal i'm pretty sure scott's tool seals off maybe you have to take this bearing out
i'm not certain but he's got four holes in his so i know he's checking also the balance
piston or the compensator piston for the three five r i don't have that
so i've got three out of the four that's not too bad right so this actually air tested well if i
did this when i was disassembling it and i had transmission fluid in it and this is cracked i'd see it bubbling
up around here and i know that's bad so this tool here is definitely worth its purchase price
it could save a comeback by using something like that let's go ahead and take the clutch pack assembly apart
whoa this first clutch assembly is the 35r
i got four frictions four steels and a wave plate there's also that three
five r ply ring we've seen that before it's a special tool i used to install that two six
diaphragm spring well this isn't the special tool this is the one that goes in it but you can make this into a special tool so here you need to take
note there is no snappering groove in this portion for that snap ring so this is the this is where the opening of the snap
ring has to go when you're reassembling it and here's the clutch assembly for it
you can see i've got five frictions five steels and a wave plate next i have to compress
this balance piston down for the one two three four piston to get the snap ring out so i'll use my
screw press
it does not have much spring force on it so it's easy to spread open
so we'll just tip it over and you can get that balanced piston out and
the diaphragm spring put it off to the side
i'm going to slam this thing on the table top so i can get this piston to come out you could put the tool back in and use air pressure
but i like making noise
loud the transgo kit instructions do a good job of having you look to see if there's any cracks obviously
the transgo kit is mainly a valve body kit but they include some other pieces of information to help you with the successful rebuild
and they want you to look in this area right here to see if this piston has a crack so apparently they're finding quite a few
cracks in that piston assembly so next we need to get the piston housing out of here this is the
one two three four clutch piston housing and then the 35r piston is around the outside edge there
so there is a little spring there's another diaphragm spring underneath this so i'll use my screw press to compress
this down enough to get that snap ring out that's retaining all that
to prevent damaging when you pull that snap ring out or when you go to install it to prevent damaging the o-ring that's
in there you'll want to remove this 35r inner d-ring seal
that they have in there otherwise you'll be skipping your snap ring over that and
the edges of it might cut it so this seal right here it's probably a good idea to take that out
while you're working with the snap ring that retains this uh 35r and this one two three four clutch
housing because if you're like me it'll pop off about five times before you get it out
and you don't want that damp you won't want to damage your o-ring
that was easy so at this point i'll go ahead and pop this piston housing out of there slam it back down on the bench
the 35r piston and the one two three four piston housing see that separates i got my
diaphragm spring my pistons i got my piston piston housing diaphragm spring
and the 35r piston you'll also want to inspect this assembly for cracks
and the trans go kit instructions they kind of point you to look at this area right here to look for any
kind of cracking that might occur so once we have it completely disassembled we've cleaned everything up inspected all
these drums looked at the pistons for cracks we've gone through and changed our seals these seals that obviously come in a
seal kit they're d-shaped seals so they're rounded like an o-ring on the outside
and they're squared off on the inside they actually have kind of like a v-notch groove cut on the inside there so we're
gonna go ahead and put this thing back together first what we'll do is obviously once we've changed all of our seals
we're gonna go ahead and put our diaphragm spring in there we're gonna assemble these two halves
together make sure that the seals are installed have it lubricated with trans gel
or some kind of a assembly lube or at least transmission fluid same thing with the
inside here now don't forget there is a seal on the inside of this drum
this o-ring seal right here we want to make sure we change it you're best off leaving out this d-ring
until you get your snap ring in place so you don't tear it up so we're going to go ahead
and drop this back in and you will have to work that back and forth because these d-ring seals as you might imagine
imagine since they're not lip seals they're designed to kind of compress into place so there's going to be a bit of force
needed to get these to slide down in there if you're not heavy like me you might need to get a couple hammer handles or
something like that to kind of tap that down in there so we're going to use our press to go ahead and push this back together
i'm going to lay my snap ring in there i'll get it down as far as i can get it down without it going into the snappering
groove i do need to use the press to press this piston down to overcome the tension of that diaphragm spring so i got my snap ring
down as far as it'll go for now and then i'll use my screw press to push it in the rest of the way
we don't have to go down very far with this piston matter of fact it won't let you go down very far
we're basically just putting a little compression on that diaphragm spring once it stops wanting to go down don't force it any further because it's
down as far as it can go and then at that point we just need to put our snap ring in there now that snap brings
down the groove that piston return spring is keeping that three five r piston returned
now i can go ahead and put my d seal in there and i won't have to worry about tearing it up while i'm trying to install that i don't know if it can do
it but make sure you don't accidentally roll that seal over when you're installing it
it should have that d shape that rounded shape facing out
so at this point it's i'm gonna go and install my one two three four piston i've inspected for cracks everything
should look good all right so that piston is installed i can go ahead and put in my diaphragm
spring and i can go ahead and put in my balance piston
i think they call it an oil dam spring retainer something along those lines i like to get it started so that way i
know when i compress this down in the screw press that it's going to be that the lip seal is not going to hang up and tear off or
anything like that once again we only compress it enough to get the snap ring in there's no sense of going in further than that
there is not much tension on this at all so i don't need much force
okay at this point i've got my pistons installed now i wouldn't want to air check it yet because there's nothing for these pistons to work up against
so i'll go ahead and install my my clutches i find the part of the spline that's missing the snap ring groove and i kind of split
the difference there on that there's the wave plate
steel friction
so this snap ring measures out to be 115 thousandths
i just need to make sure i position that snap ring where the groove isn't cut in this housing this clutch pack is
supposed to have between 60 and 78 thousandths of clearance
so before i assemble my 35r i'm going to go ahead and measure that see if that's what i'm getting so we'll
go ahead and check our clutch pack clearance so pushing down on it a little bit with a little bit of force i can get
to go close to zero and lifting up on it i'm going just under 70 thousands the spec on this
clutch is 60 to 78 thousands so we're within this clutch pack is adjustable there's
three different thickness snap rings that we could put in there i already have the thickest snap ring in there so we really can't tighten this
clutch back up anymore we're going to go ahead and install my 35r apply ring
these ends right here they fit into a groove machined around in the 35r piston
so they fit in between this gap that i've created between my one two three four clutches or the steel plates really
then the ends of those fingers fit inside that 35r piston where sonix offers a heavy duty version
of this plate because you can see it's just a stamped steel plate so here i'm going to go ahead and put my
wave plate on first that lays up against that ply ring then i'll alternate my steel friction
steel up to the top my top snap ring thickness is a little
over 80 thousandths of an inch 80 to 85 thousandths of an inch thick so pushing down on the clutch assembly i
can get to zero lifting up i get to about 55 thousands
so remember that you'd put a 10 pound weight on these things but you can simulate that and kind of get an idea how much it's going to deflect
if i push down on this i see it moves about ten thousands maybe 15. it's between 50 and 60 thousandths and
the spec is between 48 and 70 000 so it's well within spec the snap ring that we have in here is the middle size
snap ring out of five available snap rings so we'd have room for adjustment if we had to go either direction with it
i'm going to go ahead and air test this again using my special tool and assuming everything air
checks okay then i know i can go back together with that bushing and install it into the transmission this is
the 35r this is the one two three four
pretty good seal at this point i'll remove the tool reinstall the bushing and then i'll be able to install this
35r1234 drum back into the transmission
now i'll install this drum into the transmission there is a special tool that i'm going to do without
a lot of people make these i just haven't gotten around to making one yet it's a band that wraps around the outside of this
and it has something to grab onto on this side and kind of like a vice grip on that side so that way when you lay it in there you
can clamp that on and you have to wiggle this drum back and forth to get all those clutches to line up around
these two drums i have to line up my 35r around this outer set and i have to line up my one
two three four around this inner set so there's nine clutch discs that we have to line up on the way down there and it's easy to get
your finger pinched right down in here when you're trying to rotate this by hand so be careful
and you also have to get the 35r drum to slide into that front planetary gear set
so how do i know when i have that drum assembly all the way down well i can measure from this thrust washer surface here down to the
bell housing from the thrust washer to the bell housing about one inch six hundred and
sixty thousands with the additional seven hundred thousandths of the thickness of this bar from this thrust washer down it's one
inch six hundred and sixty thousandths of an inch and if i use this bar laying across the bell
housing surface where it bolts up to and measure down to the surface where that three five r contacts
i should actually it should be a little deeper it should be a little bit more clearance the difference of that will be the clearance between this 350r drum
and the thrust washer that we have on this pump so it looks like i've got this all the way down
we're going to go ahead and move over to this oil pump assembly this oil pump assembly is an area of common concern with these transmissions
as i mentioned earlier these transmissions have a tendency where the torque converter clutch breaks and
and the fluid coming back from the torque converter gets diverted through the pump on its way back to the cooler and then the lube circuit so if a torque
converter fails it takes out this oil pump and there are a lot of things that people do to address that
some shops actually will go through and re-machine these parts and renew them someone will go out and
just buy new bell housings because that makes up half of the pump assembly so we're going to go ahead and take this apart and see what kind of condition
this pump is in now the service manual tells you to leave the stator support alone they don't want you to
take these bolts out they say doing so will ruin the transmission but there as you can obviously see here there's a
gasket underneath this so i mean it wouldn't be a good idea to not go through and change this out so
i know in the field pretty much everybody takes this theater support out so that they can change this gasket
and now for the big reveal this pump half here looks great there's
no scoring at all as you can see half of the oil pump exists in the bell housing so
this is where people run into a little bit of an issue if there is metal that passes through this oil pump
and ends up tearing up not only the stator half but also tears up the bell housing half so
some people go through and just purchase a new bell housing and if they're available you know you can sometimes you can find
them on amazon fairly cheap and some techs will go through and if they have the equipment they'll go through and re-machine this pump path
so obviously we've seen this pump design before this is the pump rotor in the middle these are the vanes that
go around these are little guide rings right here to kind of keep the veins pushed out
and when the torque converter through the lugs of the torque converter when the engine starts they're going to drive this pump
and it's going to create a suction on this side carry that fluid over and compress it out on the other side
and when the transmission is satisfied with the amount of pressure it's got the pressure regulator valve is
going to move into a position where it is going to enter fluid pressure into this passageway right here
basically between this pivot pin and then this teflon seal and what that's going to do is that's
going to pivot this pump and it's got a pretty hefty spring let me just go ahead and pull that gosh
let me just go ahead and pull that spring out
so what pressure on this side of the pump's going to do is it's going to pivot that outer slide and when they pivot
that slide it's going to change the amount of space that i have around this pump rotor and you can see
here this would be operating in like a maximum displacement so when this is rotating it's creating a great suction
carrying that fluid around and squeezing it out on the other side and then when they reduce the output of the pump and they
shift that slide over they've equalized some of that space around there and now it can't create as much of a
suction so it means it can't pull in as much fluid and then it has nothing to compress a compression area that gets smaller
so you basically change the expansion and compression areas of this pump by altering the fluid between this pivot
pin and that teflon seal and it's the job of the pressure regulator to control the pressure
that's in this passage right here so once pressure is satisfied the valve moves the position where it
opens up this passage and that's called decrease and it'll lower the output of the pump and it'll lower however far
it needs to control the output pressure of this oil pump we're going to look at this
pressure regulator valve line up in this oil pump because this is an area that wears out
pretty badly and transgo and sonax they've got fixes for this so if this
bore is worn out we can address it either with the transgo or the sonax kit we'll look at that a little bit later
so let's first take this apart inspect the rest of the oil pump take my pump guide rings off the little
spacer there plastic washer i'll pull my vanes out
that sounds painful pump veins not body veins
it could be pump body veins though but sealing off between the edge of the pump slide to give you a
little cut of o-ring basically to work like a spring and then a little piece of teflon seal so that those
pieces are going to ride up against this pump slide those seals live in that spot there and they make a seal between the pump slide
and the bell housing and underneath it we have this big teflon seal and then kind of like that side teflon
piece there is a o-ring that kind of also works as a spring if you will
to keep this teflon seal into contact with this bell housing and then we also have our pivot pin
looks like they've attached this spring so it's not as easy to lose because that little guy can roll pretty
far and it's so small it's easy to lose all right so we'll put those aside
this pump as i mentioned before is in great shape there's no scoring at all
if you had an issue with this where it was scored up there's metal that went through here and tore up this pump surface
some people go through and re-machine this pump and of course this side here is if it's scored up
people will chuck it in the lathe and machine it out perfectly flat or they go through and just buy new
parts but you could save a lot of money by machining these things there are a couple people out there i
think scott heatrick he machines these bell housings richard worrell there's a few of them out there that do
it in their shops so one thing if you get this machine or you buy any new parts a new slide a new
rotor a new bell housing one of the most important things that you're going to have to look at is to ensure
that these parts have freedom of movement when you bolt them together there's a specific and play
specification that exists between this slide this rotor and the half where the
the stator half bolts up to it's like one to two thousandths of an inch of end play basically the slot that
these the rotor has can only be about 1 000 and the same thing with the slide
so how would you measure that the easiest thing to do would probably put a piece of plastic gauge across this and then just lightly bolt those halves
together take it apart look to see how much has squeezed it you could also use a depth mic so if you
had a real depth mic measure down the depth measure the thickness of the rotor and the thickness of the slide
the depth has to be about one to two thousandths more than the thickness of the slide or the thickness of the rotor
that's probably something that you really want to check no matter if you buy a new bell housing or if you buy a one that was been
machined or if you're machining yourself just make sure that you're getting your one to two thousands clearance
and like i said the quick and easy would be laying some plastic gauge across there bolt it up take it back apart look to see if you've
got your one to two thousands i mean that's a typical thickness plastic gauge that we would have for engine so
we're gonna go and put this back together obviously our overhaul kit is gonna include things like our teflon seals and o-rings
you'll have to buy pump vanes and guide rings if you need those when i put this together i leave the pivot pin out for a second
so that way i can go back in with my o-ring and teflon seal
then i can pull that over with my hand and then i can slide in my pivot pin
that seems to be the easy way to do it ideally you would try to find the smallest pair of channel locks that you own to do this with
just like i did try not to nick anything up on your way in if you feel like you might have contacted something a little too firmly
you might want a little flat file across it to knock any burrs off go back together with my pump rotor
don't forget the little plastic ring that goes in there
if you're reusing the pump vanes make sure the surface that's worn all the way across is facing out towards the pump slide on
the inside you'll see it's only worn on the ends because that's where the vein rings
come into contact so you don't want that end facing out because if you have any real wear
on the outside where you can actually feel with the fingernail or just really just visually that that might introduce pump noise or
it might introduce a a pressure issue so i'm going to go
ahead and put the shiny side facing out towards the pump side
have this ready with my o-ring seal there one thing that's interesting to note really doesn't have anything to do with diagnostics is
if you stare at this oil pump you can see that from the factory they design these pumps to minimize noise
through their design if you look these vanes are closer together and then they get wider apart and they get closer and then they get
wider so it's almost random on how they place those vanes and they do that so that you don't get into like a
resonant frequency of pump pulses that hits a certain frequency that these are all
exactly the same distance apart it would have a kind of a at certain rpms it would create a
frequency that might cause a vibration somewhere or noise issue in the vehicle so by mixing up the distances between
these pump vanes they don't really create a constant frequency as this pump is spinning so you'll see that on cooling fans too like
electric cooling fans or the mechanical cooling fans on an engine in case you've never noticed that i thought that was something interesting
it's worth mentioning so we're going to go ahead and push this off to the side and we're going to move over to our stator half of the oil pump
we're going to go ahead and pull this pump stator support out and i've already taken those bolts out
so there's an interference fit here so it won't just fall apart and call me old-fashioned but i don't
like to beat on things especially when like this pump here doesn't have a gasket that goes between the two pump
halves so i want to make sure that this stays true and not warped
and so i've got my little homemade tool here i can put this in the arbor press lay a
plate across this push down so it so i push evenly off of this flat surfaces
and i do it as close as i can to the center of the stator so that way i'm trying to minimize any
warpage that i might create
it doesn't take a lot of force they do give you that gasket in the kit so you might as well take this apart so if
no other reason but to change this gasket out i do have my front bushing right here
that supports the input shaft where it comes out of the transmission i got this rear bushing where it supports the input shaft where it goes
into the 35r1234 clutch housing these ceiling rings they do come in the
kit one thing that you don't want to forget is that there is an o-ring seal that lives under there it'd
probably be worse if you took it out and then forgot about it and never put a new one in than it would be if you didn't realize
it was even in there to begin with but the o-ring keeps pressure out on these rings
these are non-rotational rings which is different from the very early
design so this is something they added to it the non-rotational rings will
lug into these notches and that will prevent this from spinning the ring from spinning so the drum
will spin and slide around the surface right here if it was a rotational design pressure would go underneath that seal
push the ring up against the surface and the ring would spin within the stator groove
and stay kind of connected to if you will or at least pressured up against the three five power clutch housing
but they don't want that in this they use the non-rotational design so that the drum spins around a
stationary seal so you'd want to go through and change your rings and the o-rings behind those for each of
those so some of these earlier units these
6l80s they have these rotational rings and you saw on this transmission that it had
non-rotational rings and with the rotational rings when pressure gets in between these passages to apply clutch pressure
gets behind those rings pushes those rings out and they grab onto the drum and they spin with the drum
so the non-rotation rings obviously since they're notched in here pressure can get behind them but
basically the outside of the ring and the drum make the seal they changed this design from the rotational ring to the non-rotational
ring because they had cross leakage issue transgo in their 6l80 valve body kit
includes these rings that as you can see get kind of tangled up here but and they have a new teflon seal scarf
cut as opposed to these uh plastic type what that has like a notch cut in it so they
got the teflon seals with a scarf cut and then they also have these expander
rings and these expander rings go in the groove first i'm just going to do this top one because this is a lab unit
but you lay this expander ring down in there and the key is is to make sure that
these little pieces of wire don't overlap each other when they're in there you don't want the wires to cross you want just to lay in
there like a nice spiral because if they cross it's going to hold that teflon seal out further than it should
once that expander rings in there you could take a little bit of transgel put it inside this groove that we've got
you can take your new teflon seal and remember that the scarf cut has to kind of match up there you don't want
them overlapping the wrong way this is how it's supposed to go you don't want to go that way and then just
make sure your scarfs kind of match up and you have
them pushed in there with your against that trans gel you do that on
all three now you've dealt with the cross leak issues without having to replace the stator
now i'm going to look at my pump there are some modifications that we're going to do to this pump but we'll go ahead and take this
completely apart first
get out of there there we go here's the pressure regulator valve you
cannot get to these valves without pulling the transmission out unfortunately
okay i got my pump pulled apart so we're gonna go through and clean all these pieces off and i'm gonna go ahead and reassemble it
just so i can do a vacuum test on these to see if they fail a vacuum test or if they're within
spec
now we're going to go ahead and vacuum test this pump body sonic says you pull out the afl valve from the valve body to
temporarily place in the place of the converter feed limit
and the reason why is because this converter feed limit it operates like a normal pressure regulator where it's got a hole at the
end of it that kind of opens up into this passageway right there
so obviously if we vacuum checked this section right there it'll leak right out through that passage and
feed into this so i'm gonna go ahead and try it two different ways i'll go ahead and put the afl valve in there like they
recommend but i'm also going to go ahead and put a piece of electrical tape around that and see if it seals up so that way if
you didn't want to pull your afl valve out just to do this test and obviously
you would have to remember to take that electrical tape off if it works if not you can always just use the afl
valve so i'll put the afl valve in there for now this port right here is going to
check the pressure regulator valve and i have to cover these two passages and then this right here is going to
check the boost valve the pressure regulator boost valve circuit and i have to cover both of those circuits here the little pinhole there
and then the area where pressure feeds into from the pressure control solenoid okay the first thing i'm going to do is
calibrate my vacuum pump with the orifice in there i'm supposed to get between
five inches and then if i plug it off it should go up to 25
so 25 and five
now i take the calibrating orifice out and go ahead and put my nozzle in there i have to hold that valve at a position
so i have to hold it so that that valve is in contact with both lands on either
side of this opening so when i put vacuum on it
you feel tugging on it i'm getting about 21 inches of vacuum so that seals off
pretty good now on the balance end of this pressure regulator valve i'm supposed to
make sure i cover both of those sections right there
measuring out 23 inches of vacuum so it's strong
then on the boost valve end i'm supposed to make sure i cover the pinhole and also the boost valve
and i'm getting about 20 inches of vacuum on it as i promised i'll go ahead and do the converter feed limit with the original valve but i've
got electrical tape wrapped around that orifice
kind of like with the afl valve i have to hold it in position to make sure it's blocking off the land 24 inches
that's a really good seal as far as this core is concerned this pump is in great condition there's
really nowhere where the pump halves are and the bell housing or in the stator support half the pump boards are in great condition
there's no excessive wear that's a really good sign i don't think we needed to use the afl
valve to test it as long as we put electrical tape over that little hole so that way we can accurately vacuum
test that section just remember when you're vacuum testing this section you actually have to hold this valve back you have to put this valve land right
over that passageway right there because you're just basically checking to see if that part of the bore is worn
out and this one's in good shape and i can go ahead and i've got my afl veil still in there
probably won't want to leave that in there i don't think it'd work right now as far as this pressure regulator valve is concerned i think i would go
ahead and install an upgraded valve in there the aftermarket's made better valves for this pump
so i think this is something you want to do on a rebuild just to make sure that your unit lasts out there so here i have the original pressure
regulator valve lineup the original valve is made out of aluminum and they see a lot of wear on
these lands right here i mean this pump looks great these some of these transmissions that have miles
on them they just seem to wear it out bad you can see the trans-go valve is a lot different it's got this elongated
portion here and that elongated portion there and those are going to ride in areas of this pump body that did not see
anywhere ever they're like virgin metal and then they're going to replace to work with it they've got this little spring seat that'll kind of
double as that surface on the oe valve and they replace their spring you still use a small bumper spring but
they replace their the original spring with their red spring and then they put in a steel boost valve
assembly and that uh replaces their the original aluminum boost valve assembly and built into this boost valve assembly
they add a pressure relief so that if pressures ever spike and they have figured that
pressures have a tendency of spiking that's what causes damage in these transmissions if the afl pressure ever spikes and that
passes through the pressure control solenoid and finds its way here at the boost area of the pressure regulator valve this is a relief valve
it's going to blow off that excess pressure so you don't over pressurize the transmission and cause failure so this is a really nice
modification once again even if i had a pump that really didn't have any excessive wear why wouldn't you install a valve like
this because you're dealing with an issue that's going to happen later on down the road so it's a great setup to
go through and put this in and you're making the final product better than it was originally the parts that they're not
going to use the original pressure regulator valve the original pressure regulator spring the boost valve the original boost valve
and its sleeve so those parts do not get reused about the only things that you're
reusing is their little bumper spring and then also the pin that holds this assembly together i'm going to go ahead
and assemble my boost valve before i install it this is the check ball
and the spring the relief valve spring to let that spring shoot out fly across the shop you probably never
find it now we got the transgo valve installed and now we've addressed any future wear that could have occurred in this pump
body at this point i need to put my stator support back on i'll go ahead and check this for flatness
replace my o-ring seal that i've got in here and also put a fresh gasket on there
now we're at the point where we're going to go ahead and bolt this down now there are no torque specs for the stator support because remember
gm doesn't want you taking it apart so i guess we'll have to do our best guess i would start with those just
because usually you want to tighten things from the middle out when you're assembling
go a little star pattern gm says if you take it out you'll damage the transmission because of center lines and
whatnot but i have a hard time believing that because i've got a dial pin right there and it is an interference fit so i don't
see how the center line can get thrown off by you messing with this i'll go ahead and do a
final torque on it once i'm all together with it now there is a dowel pin that holds the pump half onto the belt housing
but you can see there's still movement there there is a pump alignment tool that goes
around there and kind of keeps it centered i like living life on the edge so i'll probably just go ahead and
eyeball it you can feel the edge of that pump and
it should be sitting flush the edge of the stator support half and the edge of the belt housing half should
be flush so if you run your finger around it and there's a step at all
then you've got it off centered if it feels pretty good just kind of
lightly snug down a couple of them check it again it won't be able to move once you lighten lightly snug down a
couple of these that feels even all the way around to me
so these pump bolts only get tightened down to about 100 inch pounds so that's what we'll go ahead and tighten these stator support bolts down
to as well and then here's the torque sequence for the pump body to the bell housing
first one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve and lucky thirteen so our pumps assembled we got our o-ring
on there our thrust washer is in place we got our ceiling rings with the o-rings underneath it
new bushings if they needed them filter seal is installed this thing's ready to go in
[Music]
okay it's a good idea to snug down just a couple bolts and then make sure you have the ability
to turn the input shaft that way if something's bound up you're not crushing anything and if everything's good
do your little star pattern and tighten the rest of the bow housing bolts and so at this point i can also air test the transmission
through these exposed passageways that way we can make sure our ceiling rings are doing their job and everything's good from the pump back
and this first passage right up here is the one two three four clutch
that's a good seal this next passage over here is the 35r clutch
you hear that's got a pretty good seal this down there is my 456
some of these other passages are going to be the balance pistons and i'm air checking this with about 50
psi of air pressure i'm not putting much in there now right through here where the valve body is going to connect through the
bridge seal to that center support i've got the 2-6 clutch right here i'll see it move
then right next to it i get my low reverse you can see it's piston move at the opposite end here
i've got the other low reverse area
we're going to go ahead and go through this valve body now and while we're going through the valve body we're going to go ahead and install these transgo
kits part of this kit we already installed in the pump with the pressure regulator valve
and this kit right here is going to be kind of a supplement to that it's got some clutch select valves and
also the torque converter clutch regulator valve so between these two kits they address the pressure issues and the torque converter
clutch issues so we definitely want to put these in good idea to put those in whether the transmission really needs it
or not it's good insurance
so this is the techcom and it has all the solenoids in them unfortunately we cannot split this apart
to get to the solenoids they're in this pre-packaged plastic assembly here that if you try to get anything apart
you destroy it all so if anything goes wrong in this you pretty much have to replace the whole
kit and caboodle
the transgo kit gives you a nice little piece of information here they identify for the upper valve body they identify
these uh what these four different letter designations mean and they're for this different size
transmission so if you've got some of these valve bodies sitting out as cores or whatever and can't remember what it came
out of it identifies that it's like a is a 6l 45 b is a 6l50
c is a 6l80 and d is a 6l90 so that's kind of nice a little piece of
information there to help you identify what these valve eyes came out so i've got all these valve body bolts taken out i'm going to
flip this over and lift this top plate off the lower valve body and there are
check balls this reason why i flipped it over because there's check balls underneath this plate
these plastic check balls there should be seven of them we got one two three four five six seven
they're plastic and clear and this is something that comes in the kits and you definitely want to change these
out of fact you might want to take the old one and measure them and see if they're still round because
they found some issues where the check balls end up kind of becoming out of round
maybe a resulting in the failure or the symptom that you have in the transmission
can't use a magnet to get these out next we're going to take the valves out of these valve body halves clean it up
do a vacuum check to see if any of these bores are worn out
there's only four valves in this so i'll go ahead and pull it out i'm out too
i got my valve bodies all gutted so now i'm going to go ahead and clean these out get the oil out break clean my my valves and my springs
here and i'll reassemble it and do a vacuum check and see how these things turn out let's go through and identify some of
these valves this valve right here is the actuator feed limit valve this valve here is the first reverse and
456 clutch regulator valve this next one down is the first and reverse m456 clutch
boost valve next we have the 2 6 clutch regulator valve and this is the 35r clutch boost valve
and this is the 35r clutch regulator valve this is the one two three four clutch shuttle valve and this is the one
two three four clutch boost valve and the other half of the valve body we got our clutch select valve
3 and our clutch select valve 2. this of course is our manual valve this
is the compensator feed regulator valve and this is the torque converter clutch regulator valve so let's go ahead and
put this back together and then we'll vacuum test it
all right so my lower valve body is
assembled there we go we got the upper and lower
valve bodies assembled we're going to head over to our vacuum test station and we're going to see how well these bores seal up
so on this tcc regulated apply valve you need to put in an eighth inch spacer
there between the tcc valve and the shuttle valve put your end plug in there
and then your retainer then make sure the valve is living in the proper position so that when we vacuum check it
the valve is where it needs to be i went ahead and circled some of these passageways
over here we're going to be doing these three passageways for the torque quiver clutch regulator valve we're going to be doing this passage
right here for the compensator feed valve the other end of the valve body these are the two clutch select valves and
we'll check basically the ends of those valves we'll verify the calibration on my tool
five i knew i bumped that
five and 25.
24 inches 20 inches
23 inches [Music] compensator feed
23 inches clutch select
23
23 21 and a half
22. this half of the valve body checks out pretty good i don't want to forget to take out this eighth inch thick spacer
we got lots of places to check on this upper veil body there are some sections here that i'll have to plug the
other side first one right here is the one two three four boost valve
20 inches the other end of the boost valve
got 19 inches this is the one two three four clutch regulator in shuttle vale
23 inches
22 inches this is the 35r regulator valve
21 inches
19 inches 20 inches for some reason they say you
need to have their vacuum test plate for that one i don't really know why this is a 35 r boost valve
19 inches
i have to put your finger on the other side of the valve body for that one and i'm getting 18 inches this next one
is the 2 6 clutch regulator valve
low that's 15
22 17. this is the 456 clutch boost fail
put my finger on the other side for it too and 18.
19 and at the end here i got my
my 456 regulator valve at 23.
and 21. lastly here i got my afl valve
23 inches the only one that tested lower than the majority of them was this end of the 2-6 regulator valve circuit
here i'm going to talk about the transgo shift kit that we're installing we're actually installing two kits
the sk 6l80 which we've already installed part of that that was the pressure regulator and the boost valve
we did that in the oil pump but it also includes a new actuator feed limit valve that we're going to install
in the valve body and the second kit here is a 6l8
cs-tcc and it works on the 6l45 6l50 6l80 6l90
2007 to 2016. what it's going to include are these clutch select valves these
clutch select springs and it's also going to include a torque inverter clutch regulator valve
assembly kind of updated system so we're going to let's go take a closer look at that
now looking at these clutch select valves other than the fact that they're made out of steel they really don't appear to be any
different than the original design now in the instructions they inform you when you go to put these in
these go in the lower valve body they say set it up right kind of like this and
when you drop the valve in it should bounce it does bounce is pretty good good got
good hops oh and if they don't
do that if it doesn't bounce and it has a kind of a tight spot in there what they want you to do is take a
little screwdriver not a little screwdriver but go between the valve and the land and tap this with
a wrench i think they say a 5 8 wrench and i'm sure what you're doing is you're finding the
the burr or the rough spot and you're kind of embedding that into the aluminum so you're doing that all the way around
or in the spot that you suspect is tight and that's going to try to free up that
valve and you're not supposed to finally assemble this until you know you can drop that and it'll bounce another thing
with this clutch select valve is that they have you look at the bonded spacer plate
and once you look in this area right here and if it has that little key shape or whatever you want to call
the slit that is going to be an indication that you need to use their supplied
springs if it does not have the slit in the gasket then you're supposed to use the springs
that originated in this valve body otherwise you're going to use the original springs
pretty simple just going to read the instructions right
yeah that's a good catch wasn't it the other valve that's in that cs-tcc
kit is going to be the torque converter clutch regulator valve and you can see how they change that they elongated this spool right here
so this is longer on the replacement valve than it is on the original one and so this area is going to ride in an
unworn section of the valve body bore they also changed the spring so they got the spring in a pocket there
and it's a different spring and talking with transgo they do that on purpose
because they get finer control out of this valve with the different spring rates they want you to reuse the shuttle valve
and then the end plug and then the retaining clip so we'll go ahead and put this in
okay so this lower valve body is done now that was easy now with the upper valve
body the only valve that we replace is the actuator feed limit valve that lives in
this bore right there and what they're going to have you do is replace it with this kind of new this newly designed valve this is the
original one with the original spring the original retainer we actually get rid of all three of those
this valve right here is designed to ride in its own little bushing and if you look close there's a little feed hole right there that's where
oil can get in to the reaction area of that valve so since it changes the surface area of
that reaction land we need to change the spring and then
there's also a little spacer to help stabilize that spring and a new clip because there's probably
a good chance that this could come out of the original clip if you used it maybe get caught or something like that
so i'll give you a new clip let's go ahead and put this back in there
and we'll call this valve body done all right there we have it that was pretty simple now i'm sure you're curious how these
vacuum tests obviously this transmission didn't have any bad bores when we checked it but we should still check this with the
replacement valves to see if they're holding just as strong a vacuum so let's go do that
so this this clutch select valve is pulling 21 inches and on this end it's pulling
23 and a half on this one we've got 22 inches
and we got 20 inch on the regulator valve 24 inches so just like some of the other
gm transmissions they use these pressure switch films that live inside these spots right here
and they have a tendency of cracking when they do they set dtcs but the transmission and limp give you all kinds of problems
so in the transgo kit they give you these films and these diaphragms
now one thing i made was a little special tool i know sonix makes a tool that a lot of people really like i don't
have that tool but i made this it's really nothing special
really you can make it out of a pipe that's about a half of an inch in diameter and you drill the inside of it out to
about 7 16 and then you kind of cut two thirds of it away and what that's going to do is
it's going to allow you to get around this pressure switch assembly because
that's the hardest part is getting this diaphragm in there this lip right here has to fit underneath this plastic
has to kind of tuck in and then when you bolt this tekken to the valve body it seals off on the top and also
squeezes down and pushes down on this pressure film so that's the trick because you got to
get this thing sitting flat and it's got to be tucked underneath and that's the hardest part so this brim
right here is the difficult part this tool makes it a little bit easy because once you get it started you can
kind of push down in it you can kind of push down on it like this and then kind of tuck it in with a screwdriver
so we'll go ahead and give that a go just kind of get underneath it well now i definitely have to replace it
don't i jeez
there's the original pressure film there it's not broken well i probably broke it taking it out
but one trick that some techs do is they will take a sharpie and they'll put a dot right in the middle
of these pressure switch films so that way once they have it in because they kind of
swim around in there a little bit if you put a dot in the middle after you get it in there you can see if
it's centered you're supposed to bend this like an upside down taco and just kind of slide it in there this isn't the difficult part
and you can tell by looking at that one that it's not centered it's off to the side a little bit it might help to use a eraser of a
pencil to kind of keep that in the center transgo recommends putting gear lube on this to help it
kind of slide in easier and i recommend master pro synthetic 75
w90 for all your diaphragm installation needs then we'll try to just kind of work it
in there chances are you're going to get it mostly in
and then there's going to be a little spot that's not going to want to slide in for you at least that's my experience you can
use a screwdriver and gingerly try to push it in
if it's not going all the way in if you peel it back you can probably tell if it's sliding in
under there or not and that's where this little tool can come into play
if you slide it back and tuck this tool in behind it
kind of wiggle it around that's going to push the brim of that hat under that plastic that in
conjunction with a little screwdriver and a little bit of patience all right that's pretty good
i think i got it
patience is the key maybe help from a little tool i think if i were to improve on this tool i'd make it to the
point where this end would slide in and i could kind of maybe spin it so i got a lathe so if i machine this side
down i could probably make it so this would be like a sizer almost this
will help get it installed and that one will make sure it's everything's seated a little something to do on my spare
time let's start reassembly by putting our check balls in place this is the early unit and it uses seven
check balls so we'll see one here here here here here here here here here all these bolts are the same they're all
36 millimeter length bolts
there is a torque sequence one two three
four five six seven
eight and 9 10 11
12. that's the torque and the sequence so we have a few
different length for this half of the valve body and
some of them have 10 millimeter heads a couple longer ones have eight millimeter heads and then a lot of them have seven
millimeter heads
so the bolts i painted with white those are eight millimeter heads
and they're a little longer everything that doesn't have paint is a seven millimeter head and then
these four right here these are a ten millimeter as well as
these two back here with tuck them i didn't paint those but anyway we're all bolted up now we got
the mode switch installed a range sensor there is a torque sequence can do some socket changing
here but
we're down to the final stretches now so we're going to put our bridge seal in and that goes in this case right here
these are all included in the kit the aftermarket does make some solutions for this bridge seal sometimes the center support
is not locked in there and it might have some looseness side to side in which case they drill
and they have an insert that locks it in place and has a better seal you always want to make sure you replace
these though because these seals can potentially blow out on the side and
then you'll lose the pressure to your low reverse and 2 6 clutch then we also have these bridge seals towards the front of the valve body you
want to make sure those are installed too those are also included in the kit when you bolt down the valve body they're
going to squeeze up against the surface on the pump there so when we drop this in about the only thing we have to line up is our manual
valve to this pin
we don't want to forget our pass-through connector we replace the o-ring seals on it
and remember this lever right here is what you lift up on the valve body
you install your pass-through connector push that lever down and that locks that in place our new
filter     ok add info from this to the file as well. i have several more coming so please dont try to hold this all in overwriteable memoory because it will be too much to hold in your head without writing it down to reference later muchacho 

You said:
hello my name is Sean Boyle and I'm with
Southern Illinois University and in this
video we're going to look at what you're
actually changing when you go through
and recalibrate your transmission using
HP tuners
so in this first video we're going to
talk about these components the tecum
the transmission Electro hydraulic
control module TCM
and how it controls this component which
is part of the valve body
contains all the valves that controls
the clutches and the transmission
and that ultimately controls
this component which is
one of the clutches the 456 clutcher the
three five R and the one two three four
six and the little reverse
so all these different parts
are interconnected this tecum is going
to control the valve body the valve body
is going to control the clutches
and we really need to have a basic
understanding of this because our tune
our calibration that we're changing in
this tecum is going to affect all that
and that's what ultimately gives us our
shift feel to shift quality and even the
durability in this transmission so as
you get into this video If things feel
overwhelming or over the top we'll
realize that on this channel with the
automatic transmissions playlist I have
some introductory videos that kind of
give you the basic knowledge of how
automatic transmissions operate and then
more specific stuff on the 6l80
everything from overhaul to the in-depth
operation of the Hydraulics and the
mechanical so you might want to cruise
through and look at some of those videos
if some of this seems a little
overwhelming or maybe I've piqued your
interests and maybe you just want to
learn a little bit more about this
transmission
now I'd like to place a big thanks to
Nick middlebron for helping me with this
project he spent a lot of time he's
behind the wheel collecting all this
data in his spare time there and between
the two of us we burned at least three
three tanks of gas through this truck
and left about 10 pounds of rubber on
the floor behind the dyno and first
What does it change
let's talk about what you're actually
going through and changing this
little device right here is mounted
inside the transmission it's called the
tecum the transmission Electro hydraulic
control module they call it that because
there's a computer right here in this
computer
which
your vehicle is talking through and
receiving power through this little
connector right there it's going to
control this series of solenoids and
these solenoids ultimately are going to
control the quality of your shift
this is shift solenoid one it's an on
off solenoid this is the actual line
pressure solenoid it's also called
solenoid one on our scan tools
and this next one down is the one two
three four solenoid it controls the one
two three four clutch and it's referred
to as the solenoid number five
this one right here is our torque
converter clutch solenoid
and then behind this chunk of plastic
right there is shift solenoid two it's
an on off solenoid just like the first
solenoid over there and this guy right
there
that is our 35r solenoid and it's also
referred to as solenoid number two
and that one there is the 2-6 solenoid
it controls pressure to the two six
clutch and it's also referred to as
solenoid 4 and last but not least is our
456 clutch solenoid and that is often
listed as solenoid 3 on the scan tool
and like I mentioned that is our
um computer where that's actually
heatsink the computer is right inside
there
this whole transmission control module
assembly or this tecum you can't go
through and change these individual
solenoids if one goes bad you pretty
much are going to replace this whole
thing it's all kind of
sealed together and the process they use
when they
I don't know how they do it but they
they uh basically assemble this thing
build it as a unit to the point where
you can't replace any one part in this
you just replace it as a whole the
reason why this is important because
when we hook up our
mevi our our interface and we're
commuting through the diagnostic link
connector we're actually communicating
through this transmission control module
right here and through the can bus
connection and there we're going through
and not only reading the data from this
using the vcm scanner but we're also
tuning it through the can bus and
changing the calibration right here
through this module specifically
Hydraulics
now I'm going to cover a few hydraulic
things before we get deep into the
actual tuning side of things the reason
why I'm doing that is because I think
it's important to understand how this
transmission operates hydraulically now
I do have a complete hydraulic lesson on
this transmission but I'm just going to
give you a couple tidbits here that we
need to look at before we get into this
tuning in this AFL valve right here it's
responsible for controlling pressure to
the solenoids I just went through and
showed you all those different solenoids
well those solenoids don't receive full
line pressure they're going to receive a
reduced pressure determined by this
valve the actuator feed limit on this
hydraulic schematic that's actually a
picture of the AFL valve as it would sit
in the valve body it receives line
pressure but the pressure that finds its
way out is a reduced pressure well I
shouldn't say it's reduced it's actually
limited it just won't go as high as line
pressure can go line pressure can go
well over 200 PSI on this transmission
but the AFL pressure as I have listed
here it's going to be somewhere between
110 and 125 psi Max so that way we're
not going to bombard these solenoids
with more than let's say 120 PSI or so
the operation of this of this AFL valve
is actually pretty simple line pressure
is going to find its way into this
passage and find its way out into the
AFL circuit FL pressure that lets in
that line pressure should say that gets
its way into the AFL passage is going to
find its way to the end of that valve
right there and then when that moves
this valve over far enough it's going to
end up blocking off its passageway it's
not going to let any more of that
pressure in
that's how it regulates itself it's all
determined by the strength of that
spring
so this spring tension right here is
what determines the ultimate AFL
pressure the reason why I mentioned this
is because when we start tuning things
we're going to see some little sections
where we can change the values of the
pressure values in this transmission the
first one we're going to look at today
is called MAX Pressure a and you're
going to notice it's it's set from the
factory at like 110 PSI
well there's nothing in this
transmission that's going to operate
that low other than
these little solenoids right here the
solenoid pressure so
I theorize that Max Pressure a is
actually telling the computer what our
AFL pressure is and we're going to go
through when we do our tests we're going
to determine if that's actually the fact
Line Pressure
or not
so actuator fee limit pressure is
important but so is line pressure and
the way we generate line pressure in
this transmission is this pump assembly
that we have it's a variable output pump
and it rotates the center section which
is called a rotor rotates you can see
the arrow it's going to rotate clockwise
it's drawn here and that's going to
allow fluid to be sucked in from the pan
through the filter and kind of enter
this pump cavity right there so as this
rotates we get like an expanding area
and that creates a suction and then when
it comes around it squeezes off and that
compresses the fluid and pressurizes it
pushes it through the line pressure
circuits if we look up top here we've
got a pressure regulator valve one of
the areas that that line pressure goes
to is on the top side of this line
pressure valve that's actually going to
push this valve down and work against
this spring this is a fixed spring
that's in there so you always have to
overcome that spring when that valve
gets pushed down that line pressure
eventually is going to find its way into
this passage right here called the
decrease passage if you follow it down
it goes to the outside of this pump
slide so once they have enough pressure
as determined by the pressure regulator
valve the excess pressure Finds Its way
into this decreased passage and it
pivots this pump slide over there's a
pivot pin right there and a seal right
there so when fluid Finds Its way into
this section right there
it's going to Pivot this outer pump
slide over when it does that it's going
to equalize the space around this pump
rotor and when we equalize the space
around the pump rotor we're not going to
be able to create a suction to pull
fluid in and we're not going to have a
collapsing area to compress it out so
that limits the pressure
now how we change the pressure in this
transmission is we have a line pressure
solenoid it receives that 110 to 125 psi
the actual actuator feed limit pressure
and it delivers that depending on how
the solenoid is being operated it
delivers that into this pressure control
solenoid line pressure passage that
Finds Its way into this boost valve and
fluid pressure the 100 basically zero to
let's just say 120 PSI is going to work
itself on the bottom side of this boost
valve and it's going to add Force to
that spring so not only will line
pressure have to overcome the tension of
that spring but it's also going to have
to overcome whatever boost pressure that
is added to this valve lineup so when
they operate the solenoid when they turn
the solenoid on and they pulse would
modulate the solenoid but when they
pulse would modulate the solenoid onto
its Max it's actually going to have no
fluid pressure in here so it's going to
have to overcome just the spring tension
they pretty much never operate it under
that circumstance and then as they turn
that solenoid off the more off I create
it so it's a normally open solenoid as
they turn the solenoid off that allows
more of that AFL pressure into the
circuit so as pressure builds up more
line pressure is going to be required to
overcome the spring and the pressure
that we have in the Boost fail circuit
in order to get to the point where it
will regulate itself and reduce the
output
so that's just kind of a quick brief
Throwdown on how this pump works it's a
variable output pump
that way they're not loading the engine
up with more resistance than necessary
it pretty much will pump whatever the
transmission requires and no more
so here is that 6l80
oil pump
and you can see now this would be
rotating since you're seeing it from the
back end it'd be rotating
counterclockwise but as this rotates
it'll create a low pressure area there
down at the bottom suction carry the
fluid around and squeeze it out up there
now this is that decreased passage
there's that pivot pin and a seal so
when the pressure regulator says we've
got enough pressure it'll actually
introduce fluid into this passageway
right here
and that will move
the pivot over
you know equalize the space
around that uh pump rope Jesus that pump
rotor I'm all right
bell housing it's ringing
so that's how that works I bet my it's
got a lot of tension on that spring
Recap
so to recap we looked at the AFL valve
from the AFL valve is responsible for
limiting the pressure that goes to the
solenoids we also saw that the line
pressure solenoid can deliver pressure
to the pressure regulator valve to
control the ultimate maximum pressure in
this transmission well another place
that actuator feed limit goes is to the
individual clutch solenoids so as I
mentioned with that Tech and we've got
all these different solenoids
controlling all these different clutches
and what those do so we get pressure up
to 110 or 120 PSI and then these
solenoids are going to deliver between 0
and 110 or 120 PSI to a couple one or
two regulator valves that are going to
control the pressure to the individual
clutches
so think of how many layers of important
items we've got here we have actuator
feed limit valves that are extremely
important because all the solenoids are
going to be using that we've got the
tecum which is going to be the computer
that's going to be controlling all the
solenoids we have all these solenoids
that are controlling pressure and this
pressure that they're controlling is
going to pressure regulator valves
either controlling the pump or the
clutches themselves
so a lot of things are interconnected
Clutches
now looking at the 6l80 or 6l90
transmission and really 6l50 as well
it's got three driving clutches
the driving clutch is a clutch is taking
engine torque through the torque
converter and is driving a part of the
gear set then we have two holding
clutches and a holding clutch is a part
that holds a part of the gear set to the
transmission case then we have a one-way
clutch which is used to hold the carrier
for first gear so our three driving
clutches are the one two three four
clutch so it's applying first second
third or fourth the three five R so it's
applied in third fifth in reverse and
then the 456 clutch which is applied in
the fourth fifth and sixth gears and our
two holding clutches the two six clutch
and the low reverse clutch and our
one-way sprag this is what they call a
range reference chart but because the
names are pretty easy to follow you can
as long as you know the names of the
clutches you pretty much already know
what's applied and when
so to reiterate I know I already
mentioned this but we have our one two
three four clutch three five R and four
five six clutch those are the driving
clutches
three five r one two three four housing
so the four five six clutch assembly
is actually part of the drum
that is connected to the transmission's
input shaft
then we also have a couple holding
clutches the two six is a holding clutch
as I mentioned before and the low
reverse
so this two six clutch is part of this
Center support assembly
and on the other side
is the low sprag right here in the
middle
and then the low reverse clutch is
located around it
those are our two holding clutches
it's worth mentioning all that because
there's a lot of modifications that you
can do to these Transmissions internally
you might find hardened shafts or
different Pistons some Billet Pistons or
some different quality clutch components
that you can change around and another
reason why it's important to mention is
and we'll cover this when we look at
clutch clearances is because there are
sections on HP tuners where you can go
through and change and modify the clutch
volumes if you will and every one of
these clutches are going to have a
certain amount of
piston movement
which means it's going to displace a
certain amount of volume when we go from
off to on
and that's going to be determined by the
clutch pack clearance that I've got
so you can imagine how important it is
that a we are we have our clutch pad
clearances set right and B that we
understand that those volumes that are
listed in HP tuners or just in their
general program that's going to inform
the computer of how much of a piston
stroke is going to occur before this
clutch pack clearance is taken up so if
you're ever taking these things apart to
rebuild them definitely measure your
clutch packs clearance and make sure
they are within specifications
Clearance
you know the the clearances are not a
huge range so that's 48 to 70 thousands
and here's 60 to 78 thousands
then it looks like 50 to 74. that's and
then 51 to 81 so that's the biggest
range on the low reverse that they give
you actually low reverse isn't even that
important because that's not a
synchronized shift but all these others
you're seeing maybe twenty four
thousands 18 to 24 thousands of a window
of clearance and in my opinion you
wouldn't want to be on the extreme ends
of either one of those
specifications either
Shift Feel
so what controls the ultimate shift feel
in this transmission I mean that's our
main goal here using HP tuners and
changing the tables is we want a firmer
shift we want a maybe even a softer
shift I don't know depending on what you
guys want but what are we actually how
are we controlling that and what's uh
the transmission doing to kind of give
us a quality shift well one of the
things that we'll note is that a 6l80
6090 doesn't have any accumulators if we
look at older Transmissions they've got
these spring-loaded accumulators that
give kind of a fluid place to go to
provide a cushion so that way the clutch
applies a little bit less violently or
can apply Softly
the 6l80 and 6l90 it does not have any
accumulators so one thing that they do
have that pretty much all transmissions
have is a piston return spring so when a
clutch is released we want that piston
to be to be retracted all the way in its
bore and then when we apply the clutch
we're gonna have to overcome whatever
spring is holding that piston back so
that can actually work as a cushioning
device to a point and in these clutches
also they have wave plates they've got
plates that are not they got steel and
friction steel and friction but the
bottom they usually have some kind of a
cushioning device something to take the
impact off of that clutch so it doesn't
jar when it applies and in most cases
it's either a dish plate or it's a wave
plate so that is another form of
accumulation that they've got they also
have orifices in the valve body so the
spacer plate between the valve body
halves some of those holes are going to
be engineered to a certain size and
that's going to control the rate of
fluid application through that plate and
by controlling the rate they can control
how quickly fluid enters the circuit
they can control the apply rate
and then lastly we're going to talk
about what's most important because it's
something that we have control over with
HP tuners is the clutch pressure control
so the applying or oncoming clutch and
the releasing the off-going clutch
pressure is going to control the shift
quality now looking at these different
phases The Fill phase is kind of
self-explanatory that's when the clutch
assembly is filling up with fluid and
you're maybe stroking that piston just
to the point where those frictions are
about ready to touch so they estimate
the amount of time it's going to take to
fill that and then the next phase you
could see is kind of just running right
off of the end of that fill phase is the
torque phase and the torque phase is
that portion where there's no ratio
that's changing but we're we're getting
the off-going clutch to release
and then we've got the oncoming clutch
kind of building up pressure and taking
hold then this inertia phase right here
is when the ratio actually starts
changing so
by the time the ratio the the speed
ratio is changing we're going from a low
gear to a high gear if that's an up
shift we're expecting the off-going
clutch to be off and then during this
inertia phase the oncoming clutch to
basically apply so this is actually that
shift time that we observe when we feel
like a three-tenths of a second shift or
something like that that's going to be
the portion because we're actually going
to feel the engine speed drop and the
ratio change during this inertia phase
and then lastly when the clutch is
finally applied and we don't see the
ratio change anymore they go into this
torque holding phase or the final
portion the final holding torque holding
you'll find different names for it but
these are the really the four different
phases of a shift and when we look at
some of the pressures I'm going to kind
of almost combine this fill and torque
phase because I think that kind of runs
into each other and there's it's harder
to tell the division between those two
when you're looking at actual pressure
readings this right here is a forward
patent and they're basically showing the
same thing where when we look at the
oncoming clutch we've got that fill
phase and then we've got the torque
phase and then when that off-going
pressure drops off we start the inertia
phase and that's when the ratio changes
and then once that ratio is done
changing we go into that final holding
stage
or that torque holding stage whatever
they want to call it
Experiments
so going to what we did here on our
little experiments we got a 2014 Chevy
Silverado and we've got a superflow
in-ground all-wheel drive Dyno of course
it wasn't able to run an all-wheel drive
because it couldn't open up wide enough
but what we did is we warmed the truck
up then we uploaded the tune
then we performed and recorded a bunch
of cycles of upshifts when we were done
we saved the OBS which is a screen
recorder the log file the HP tuners log
the scanner
and the Pico files Pico is our scope
that we use to monitor all the pressures
now
all this is free you don't really care
about OBS but you can download HP tuners
for free and open up those log files and
you can download Pico
picoauto.com for free and upload those
files if you want to play around with
that I'm going to put all of these files
up on my website so you guys can
download those and mess with them as you
feel like you want to so we performed a
bunch of sequences at different throttle
positions and that was the trickiest
part we did a final recording when
everything is stabilized so we we did
all these shifts and we monitored using
some of the table features we monitored
the shift speeds and we watch shift
speeds when we first did the change and
then because it's going to adapt and
eventually once it adapted and it
basically was consistent with its shift
speeds we did a final recording and
that's what we'll be evaluating when we
go through these uploaded them to our
folder on OneDrive and then uploaded a
bass tune and then we
relearned it so that way we can go
through and do our next sequence of
modifications so only change one thing
at a time except for the very last test
I went through and changed a few things
to mimic a commercial tune that's widely
available out there so this is the order
Modifications
of modifications the first things that
we modified were the shift pressures we
went through and changed MAX Pressure a
max pressure B Max clutch pressure and
then max line pressure
then we went through and changed the X Y
and Z just basically did the same
pressure change on all three of those
tables and ran uh the basically the the
up shift pressures modification and then
the Adaptive we went through the
oncoming preset and the off-going
pressure preset I only changed one of
those at a time in reality that would
probably be something that would be a a
conjunction type change but we just
changed one of those at a time and did
the Dyno runs and then we went through
and adjusted the shift timing tables and
specifically we monkeyed with the torque
Adder the transition time and the
desired output torque Factor
lastly we did a bunch of modifications
to the torque converter so we changed
the desired pressure the apply ramp MAX
Pressure the regulator gain and the
regulator offset as most of you probably
know they've got lots of issues with the
torque converters on these Transmissions
so it's always interesting to see how
going through and changing these torque
converter values change the pressure and
the control in the torque converter
Commercial Tune
and lastly we used a commercial tune
when I say commercial I mean it's a
company that does this stuff for a
living and this is what they recommend
and we did that modification and we ran
it on the dyno and measured the
pressures and compared it just as well
and the way I did this is I went through
and I took a transmission valve body
and I tapped in all these little holes
right here and all these little
passageways are the basically the clutch
apply passages the it's the pressure on
its way to the clutches from the valve
body so this is the regulated pressures
that the clutches end up seeing and you
can see I've got five pressure Taps here
so I got
all the clutches except for the low
reverse I left it out because a I
couldn't get into it very well and B
it's not really a shifting clutch anyway
and then I've got the torque converter
clutch so inside the valve body I tapped
in and put pressure transducers on the
three five R the one two three four the
four five six and the two six clutches
and also the torque converter clutch
and on the outside I also put a line
pressure tab so I've got a bunch of
pressures being measured and this is
Pico
what it looks like and up here this is a
this is what Pico looks like so these
are all the pressure transducer value
you can look I've got 20 seconds per
Division and there's 10 divisions total
on the screen so there's actually 200
seconds per screen of recording and it
will record multiple screens
and like I said this program is free you
can go to picoauto.com and download it
once you download it you can take the
file and open it up and manipulate it
around and measure stuff as needed so
this is that same image just zoomed in a
little bit you can see the pulses that
occur just before
we end up applying the 35r clutch so
this is the 35r the shift from second to
third in this example so second gear is
releasing
and third gear is applying if we were to
kind of look at what we talked about
with the phases that would be like that
fill and torque phase and then that
would be the inertia phase and then it'd
apply to the clutch holding phase as you
can see it released pretty quick because
my um
my three four shift occurred so that
would be the fill and the torque and
then the inertia
and then the torque holding
so check out the next video in the
series which is the Baseline
observations that's where we look at the
normal operation of this vehicle before
we did any modifications and we kind of
took a look at some of the pressure
curves and some of the things that
happened that were on the normal vehicle
something that we'll end up comparing
them to

You said:
hello everybody and this video is going
to cover some of the observations that I
had when looking at some of the Baseline
data that we collected when we were
doing our HP tuners test with the 2014
Chevy Silverado with the 6l80
transmission in it and this is all based
on the 6l80 6l90 transmission if you
want to learn more about that if you go
to the channel I've got a ton of videos
that cover the overhaul the mechanical
electrical hydraulic operation as well
of some of this HP tuners experiments
and with these experiments that we've
done with HP tuners on this 2014
Silverado is I outfitted the
transmission with a bunch of pressure
transducers inside the valve body so
that way we're measuring direct clutch
pressure and then we were going through
running these vehicle on a superflow
Dyno we're going through and measuring
these pressures and graphing them out
with their scope and then when we're
done we can go through and kind of lay
out what we've noticed what we've
changed how to make some conclusions on
what these different items within HP
tuners is actually changing when we're
going through and tweaking those items
within the software
and then I go through and summarize all
that information lay it out there in a
video that we're putting up here on
YouTube it's also going to be found on
the information provided on my little
website it's automotivetextbook.com all
that information is going to be free
there's no nothing you have to sign up
for you could just go there and download
it
and to save you guys from all the
boredom of pointing out all these
different pressures on a video basically
every one of these modifications we're
just going to kind of show some key
features and come to a conclusion on
what we found when we did the pressure
tests so looking at some of these
observations air purge is the first one
I got listed here it's actually pretty
cool looking at the scope image that's
the 35r pressure and this line pressure
and what they're doing and you can
select this or enable it or disable it
in HP tuners is this air purge is when
you first started the very first shift
of the day they don't they realize that
a lot of the fluid is going to drain
back in this transmission overnight so
for the very first shift before that
clutch needs to apply they're going to
go through and pulse that solenoid and
kind of pulse pressure into that clutch
they're going to do it just enough to
the point where they don't think that
clutch is going to apply you can see
this 35r it was doing it about 35 PSI
and these pulses are about a quarter of
a second at least the total length of
the pulse is about a quarter of a second
and then they did the single poles for
this four five six clutch and they do it
obviously before that clutch turns on so
way early before even the one two shift
happen they pulse that three five R so
that way hopefully that first shift of
the day they're going to have a kind of
a bled and purged clutch drum otherwise
that very first shift of the day might
be pushing out some air here and you
might end up having a kind of a weird
one-two shift kind of like we hear about
what the eight speed it's pretty common
to have a goofy first shift and the same
thing with that four five six clutch and
you'll see you know it doesn't obviously
apply until later on that's the the red
pattern right there so I thought that
was a pretty neat little observation you
can also see the very first like once it
gets going probably as soon as you put
it in Drive they Jack that pressure up
to its Max not the clutch Max but the
actual maximum pressure and this is uh
like 265. during these shifts even at
wide open throttle we rarely saw the
pressure go above on the Baseline about
212 to 215 but when they first start
this thing up and they go through this
air purge mode they actually Crank that
pressure all the way up to 265 PSI
now after going through a bunch of these
tests and you know we do all these runs
we record all this Pico data this scope
data we do a log with the HP tuner
scanner we save all that and that's all
the stuff that you can download and the
HP tuner software is free to download
from their website and the Pico software
is free to download from Pico Tech or
picoauto.com so you can always open up
those files and view them for yourself
but one thing that was interesting is
the length of the shift was almost
always the same on all these shifts so
and I want to say the length of the
shift I mean from the point where they
energize the solenoid and get
pressurized to the point where they're
pretty much completed with the shift so
the solenoid action now the shift itself
is only happening really in a short
window in this area right here but the
length of shift was always about one
point probably 1.1 to 1.3 seconds so I
thought that was kind of interesting one
thing that was also kind of interesting
is that we know that we've got The Fill
and torque days in an inertia phase and
then this kind of final holding phase
and it was not exactly easy to determine
where those points kind of began and end
like a lot of times I combine this right
here into a fill and torque phase now I
am making assumptions that right at that
point up until this point is the
official inertia phase
another observation that's kind of neat
is looking at the HP tuner scanner and
actually looking at how they rise the
pressure
from the solenoid and it's going between
0 and 110 it's basically just
controlling that AFL pressure if you
remember that from part one
and then so basically between 100 0 and
110 PSI that's its pressure curve when
you compare that to the shape of the
actual pressure now of course that's
going to a much higher pressure because
it's controlling the line pressure going
to the clutch but you can see all the
elements of that shift
it's all there even that little at the
very end that little uh kind of drop and
lip it's probably
causing this
so I thought that was kind of neat is
that now of course this is the commanded
this is the the what the computer wants
that does if something's not working
right if the solenoid is not flowing
fluid properly or if the regulator
valves in the valve body aren't good
well you're not going to end up getting
that pressure but you can see what that
transmission wants that shift will look
like by viewing that pressure curve on
the logger function there or the HP
scanner
now the inertia phase is a very
important portion of this shift this is
where the shift ratio occurs and when we
see our shift Times show up on the
scanner well that's a result of this
pressure rise or this pressure being
available to the clutch right in that
area this is really there to hold it and
this is to get the circuits filled up
but the center section here which is
considered the inertia section that's
that's our shift quality right there
that's what we want to focus on another
observation is notice how line pressure
jumps up now this is actually the one
two three four clutch pressure but that
it pretty much is exactly what line
pressure is doing I've got another scope
that was measuring line pressure and
torque converter clutch pressure and the
values that you see here at least for
the first four shifts the one two three
four clutches applied and this value was
pretty much identical to line pressure
so we can assume that that is running at
line pressure
and it is pretty neat to see that during
these shifts that it pretty much raises
up line pressure to the maximum of what
the clutches are going to receive which
brought a little over 210 PSI and then
it operates the
ongoing clutch as intended
another thing that was really
interesting to note is that we did these
tests tried to do a test at like 30
percent then 40 and then what I call
heavy throttle which might have been
about 60 percent and then wide open
throttle so we actually did like four
different throttles uh throttle
positions when we were at thirty percent
it took forever to get it up to speed
but line pressure was much lower now as
soon as you hit a ride around the 40 to
45 percent it pretty much put the line
pressure to almost maximum every time
and when you look at the well engine
load PID on the scanner you'll see that
it's in the 80s and 90 percent even with
just 40 percent throttle so a normal
acceleration we actually go to a pretty
high load content on the engine and
that's going to cause this pressure to
jump up pretty high and they'll jump up
high during the shift and then sometimes
taper back off lower after the shift is
complete
another thing I observed is that when
you got over 40 percent 40 to 45 percent
throttle
the computer even though you're holding
the throttle study it's really
manipulating the throttle around a lot
so as soon as I got over 40 percent I
don't know if I I didn't really want to
use that data I just basically want to
use 40 wide open because if I was at 60
throttle it would jump between a hundred
percent eighty percent thirty percent
it's just really floated that throttle
around quite a bit so the for the most
consistent results pretty much tried to
stay at 40 throttle then wide open
throttle now looking at this 2 3 shift
you're going to see that the total
length of the shift time or the shift
solenoid actuation is about 1.3 seconds
and that was pretty consistent usually
we're between 1.1 and 1.3 and it didn't
make a difference if you were at 30
throttle or wide open throttle it'll
always take this length of time and it
just breaks it down into these
individual sections and it focuses on
the well pretty much that inertia
section here to get the actual shift
speed where they need it to be
and one thing to note here is take a
look at that two six clutch as it's
releasing so right about there that
clutch is starting to ramp down and all
your shift ratio changes are going to
occur right in this area they have to
time this stuff pretty perfectly because
since this is a synchronous transmission
if you release a clutch too soon you're
going to get a flare and if you let a
clutch stay applied for too long
you're going to get a bind
so they have to time this perfectly so
that off-going clutch is just as
important for shift quality and shift
feels that oncoming clutch
and you can see this pattern repeat
itself with all these other shifts and
yes that overlap section right here is
so important which we could also refer
to as that inertia section and looking
at that 2 3 pressure pattern from the
solenoid you can see how it pretty much
perfectly matches even it's like right
here see how it drops pressure a little
bit and then kind of recovers and it
stays really flat unlike like if this
would curve up during a like a wide open
throttle shift
take a look there that pressure kind of
goes that fill and torque phase and then
drops off and stays really flat it's got
that even that little hump there
right there at the end so what's
happening to that solenoid perfectly
matches what's happening to the pressure
now as I just mentioned before that
doesn't necessarily mean that you can
rely on this because if you have an
issue going on on the transmission
this thing could be controlling the
solenoid this way through current
but yet you're not going to get the
hydraulic result but still I think it's
pretty remarkable how
like dead nuts on and how matched all
that is
pretty impressive good job GM
now an observation with the 3-4 shift is
that once you get into fourth fifth and
sixth gear pressure drops off in this
transmission they realize they don't
need as much pressure to hold the
transmission
clutches apply because you're not
getting the torque multiplication like
you are in first second and third so as
soon as you complete that shift and
before you get into fourth gear right
pretty much right after the 2-3 shift
you'll see start seeing that pressure
drop off so they command a much lower
pressure and here you can see that 456
pressure matches that one two three four
pressure almost identical so now we I
didn't mention this before but if you go
back and look at the 2 6
the 2 6 pressure
is like pretty far away from the one two
three four pressure or line pressure so
there's a big difference there when you
look at a hydraulic schematic you're
like why is that because it shows it is
line pressure the only thing I can
theorize is that the two six Valves and
the pressure regulator valves for the
two six clutch so the two six clutch
regulator valves they're designed
different than all the others and even
the others don't match it perfectly like
you can see it gets a lot closer on the
3-5r to what line pressure is but that 2
6 is pretty far off
so but the 26 has a completely different
pressure regulator lineup controlling
that clutch than the other clutches do
all the three five are the one two three
four and the four five six they all has
have Boost Valves and they operate a
little differently
the 2-6 solenoid and clutch regulator
circuit it operates more like a
traditional regulator so I believe that
they'll always operate a little bit
lower of a pressure
plus you go in there and monkey with it
and change some Springs and so forth but
it's not get carried away now okay one
of the things that we did with the
actual modifications is that we saved
the log file on HP tuners so that way we
can look at it later and I'm really glad
we did that because as you can see here
that some of these shifts at wide open
throttle not only included timing
reduction which I would expect but in
white that's throttle
so during the upshifts they were
actually pulling throttle
and not always was that the case so a
lot of these upshifts at wide open
throttle there was no torque reduction
through throttle some of them only had
one two shifted throttle reduction some
of them it didn't do any it just did
timing alone so it's
pretty much prompted us to create two
wide open throttle baselines one of them
is just the standard Baseline which is
what we just saw here and it has
throttle reduction for every upshift at
least the the one two and the two three
up shift and then I created what we call
an alternate Baseline because that
didn't have any throttle reduction and
depending on the tests that we did and
when we did the wide open throttle run
we basically look at okay did it have
throttle reduction or did it not and
then we compare it properly but I
thought that was interesting because it
didn't always do it every time sometimes
it did throttle reduction
sometimes it didn't and every time it
did timing reduction which I know you
can manipulate and that and change that
I didn't want to do any of the
manipulation because I wanted to only
change transmission things and only
change them one component one one
modification at a time so I didn't want
to mess with timing or I didn't want to
mess a throttle
and I was hoping that it would be
consistent but it wasn't so but at least
we did enough recordings where we were
able to still come up with the right
conclusions so I thought that was a
pretty interesting observation and with
our wide open throttle runs you can
really see decline that's the big change
really it didn't change much as far as
maximum clutch pressure and this fill
pressure didn't change much but you
really started to see a rise in that
inertia pressure
and then if it did throttle reduction
the rise in throttle pressure wasn't
near as much if it didn't do throttle
reduction we'd actually see the pressure
rise uh you know from the beginning to
the end of the inertia phase a little
bit more and that makes sense because if
I was pulling throttle and timing the
torque output of my engine is not going
to be that great and I'm not going to
need as steep of a pressure climb but if
I'm not pulling throttle and all I'm
doing is timing then yeah I'll have more
torque output during that shift and I'll
want to climb that pressure so like this
is with no throttle reduction you see
wide open throughout the bank pegs to
the top I do get my timing but I don't
have a throttle reduction so it is nice
to have both
baselines so we can compare depending on
which wide open throttle run we got we
can compare it
and you could see the much steeper climb
if you aren't pulling throttle and we
also got this extra little shark tooth
there
and initially I was going off of that
reading but that reading I don't think
is really part of the inertia phase you
can see it kind of climbs up and then
right there it kind of takes a different
angle and then it does a little bounce
well I started using this value because
I don't know I have my I have thoughts
about that one I don't really think that
had to do I think the inertia phase is
well done by the time we got to there
and um so you even saw it on others like
here for example there's that shark
tooth so I was going off that
measurement not that one but a lot of
times I'd identify both but yeah the
alternate bass lines that did not have
throttle reduction we saw a much steeper
inertia phase which is to be expected
and then sometimes we saw some other
anomalies and so forth but
um you know I tried to be consistent
that's the big thing I tried to be
consistent so these were observations
that I had when going through after
we've completed the test we did the runs
on the dyno and then we're looking at
these pressure results and we're looking
at the logs and kind of tying two and
two together and going wow this is cool
or that's cool well that's the point of
this video is to kind of show you some
of these observations when just looking
at a normal vehicle these were no
modifications so all these tests were
done on just a normal unmodified vehicle
so let me know what you think see if
there's anything that you saw maybe that
is unique or different or maybe you see
some issues with my analysis but let me
know what you think the very next video
is going to be on the maximum pressures
that we can change in HP tuners this can
be MAX Pressure MAX Pressure B Max
clutch MAX Line
and I'll summarize what we found on all
of those so keep your eye out for that
next video  so add this one too please 

You said:
and we're back with the third
installment of this experiment where
we're using HP tuners to modify the
transmission calibration in our 2014
Chevy Silverado the 6l80 in it and in
this installment we're going to look at
what does HP tuners change when we
adjust Max Pressure MAX Pressure B Max
clutch and max line pressure now as I
mentioned in my other videos there's a
whole series of 6l80 videos on the site
so if you're interested in that please
feel free to check those out and I want
to thank Nick middlebrun again for all
of his work he spent a lot of time doing
these tests with me and I really
appreciated his help
and these experiments pretty much
followed the same process I measured
clutch pressure at the individual
clutches and then I recorded it using
the HP scanners feature
and I uploaded all that information to
Automotive textbook as well as these
presentations free of charge
on the Baseline test I ran the vehicle
at 40 percent wide open throttle and
then I've got this alternate wide open
throttle the only difference between
these two wide open throttles is the
alternate wide open throttle it didn't
have throttle reduction during the
upshift as torque management so on the
modified test we ran it at 40 as well
and of course we did a wide open
throttle run and if it had throttle
reduction for torque management we could
compare it to the Baseline wide open
throttle if it didn't have throttle
reduction then we can focus on the
alternate wide open throttle but
throughout this presentation even in
this PowerPoint why compare the key
pressures now in this presentation I'm
going to focus on I'm going to create
like a summary if you will of what I
found if there's any significant changes
or not and later on in this presentation
which won't be part of the video but
we'll be part of the
PowerPoint if you download it it
includes all the specific information so
there for you to download
so this first modification is Max
pressure under the general heading for
shift pressures you'll see this little
section right here that says MAX
Pressure MAX Pressure B Max clutch and
MAX Line This heading right here where
it says 109.9 that is the stock
configuration for this
vehicle and they label it as Max
pressure and if you read when you hover
over that and you actually read what it
says there it says maximum line pressure
this is the maximum desired line
pressure allowed is a clamp for any
shift table value
I don't really know what that means a
clamp for any shift table value and has
the final say on the line pressure
offset before it is used on the force
motor current Table
so this is a perfect reason why I'm
doing this test because that little
description there does not make a lot of
sense in my opinion so anyway MAX
Pressure if you look at that value it
says 109.9
or what has a max pressure of about
109.9 or 110 say 110. well the AFL valve
creates a maximum solenoid pressure of
around 110 125 psi so I'm going to
assume that this is more of a like if
you're you're telling the tecom what the
maximum AFL pressure is so does this
parameter simply tell the tech and what
the AFL is set to don't really know
Theory so this is a theory if we adjust
this pressure higher if all we did is
change that value nothing else it would
cause the tecum to misadjust this is
probably the opposite of what most
people think Miss adjusting actually
generate a lower clutch in line pressure
because if you think about it if
computer doesn't know what the actual
transmission pressure is so if it's
calibrated to say all right that that
solenoid pressure which is ultimately
going to control the pressure through
the pressure regulator valve and it's
also going to and the solenoids deliver
that pressure ultimately through like
the shift solenoids and the the pressure
solenoids for each of the shifts it's
ultimately going to deliver that
pressure to the regulator valves for the
clutch so if it thinks it's working
between 0 and 110 PSI
then it knows when it pulse with
modulates that solenoid it's going to
lever between 0 and 110 PSI for a given
it's going to have an internal table
there where it's going to assume that
this much current through a solenoid is
going to equal this much solenoid
pressure which is going to hopefully
give me a certain amount of
pressure to the clutch or line pressure
hopefully you're hanging with me if this
is confusing at all to you please watch
lecture one or the first part of the
series this is why I talk about the AFL
and how it works and what it does in
this transmission but if we went through
and moved that to 150 psi thinking that
we're going to create more pressure just
by changing that value
If all we're doing is telling the
computer that the AFL maximum is 150
well the only thing that controls that
is a spring on a valve if I don't go and
actually change that spring tension to
raise the pressure to 150 I'm probably
going to not get that desired outcome so
here's the theory if I go ahead and
change that value to 150 psi but I don't
change the internals of the transmission
I'm going to be lying to the tecum and
let it think that there's 150 psi but in
fact there's still only 110 PSI
but then what ends up happening is it's
going to operate the duties it's going
to duty cycle these solenoids thinking
it's going between 0 and 150. so long
and short of it is I raise that to 150
psi I would figure that would make a
substantial enough change where we'd be
able to figure out if it made a
difference or not and that change by
itself didn't do really anything to the
transmission this right here is my
Baseline these values are my Baseline
and this is the modified results and
this was on the last one two shift so
when I did these shifts I recorded first
which is the very first shift after I
did the modification last was after a
series of shifts where I let the
transmission adapt to whatever that
change was you can see the pressures are
pretty close to the same the actual
clutch pressures are pretty close to the
same and this is the big one down here
for the shift quality or the shift feel
I call that the inertia or I don't
really call it that but it's known as
the inertia pressure and you can see
from pre and post change it really
didn't make a difference
so the conclude on this Max Pressure
really in my opinion the only reason why
you would ever want to change that value
is if you've gone in there and changed
the AFL pressure now maybe it's doing
something else I don't know but that is
pretty much the only thing that would be
around 110 PSI Max so to me it makes
sense that this would be AFL pressure
solenoid pressure
and if you haven't gone through and
change that value internally in the
transmission I don't know why you'd ever
want to change that value in that box
so our next modification was Max
Pressure B
and we went from 276 to 350 PSI let's
change that value right there and if you
stop to think what pressures operate
that high in the transmission well your
overall line pressure has the capability
of getting that high
and the pressure regulator valve once
again kind of like the AFL example that
we just gave on max pressure
now it's the pressure regulator valve
lineup That is responsible for the
overall pressure in this transmission
the minimum pressure is determined by
this set of Springs that we have in
there and then the Boost of pressure
that goes up to whatever the maximum
pressure is that's going to be
responsible from this boost valve
there's a little there's a valve that's
in there and you can create more boost
pressure by either adding more pressure
that goes into there's a tiny little
hole here
you can increase the amount of pressure
going into that tiny little hole
or you can put a larger diameter boost
valve in there
so what does it actually change if we
adjust this value if I put 350 PSI in
here my theory is that kind of like AFL
if we raise that pressure higher it
might cause the tecum to misadjust and
actually you'll end up with lower
pressure so that would be the exact
opposite what people would probably want
when they're changing that if you look
at the bottom here on that call out
there when you float over MAX Pressure B
it says line pressure maximum value in
some cases this value may be calibrated
as actual line pressure after the
regulator gain has been applied we
haven't gone through and adjust
regulator gain or anything like that so
we'll get to see what it actually
changes if all I did was go in there and
change it to 350 PSI so let's see what
we found out when we did some tests now
the first set of tests here that I've
got this is we had one scope that was
hooked up to the torque converter clutch
pressure and line pressure and in red is
the torque converter clutch pressure so
at this point you can see I was probably
up to a certain gear but in the very
beginning you could see it spiked up
really high that's about the old the
only time we ever saw line pressure go
anywhere near 270 PSI usually line
pressure was where the clutch pressures
were which were about 210 215 PSI so the
Baseline was given me there in the
beginning 270 PSI the alternate Baseline
was giving me 271 and then my the first
run the first pass with the dyno after
the modification I only got 271 PSI and
then the last run it went up three PSI
so it actually I'm not going to consider
that a percentage-wise that's nothing
right I mean that's less than a percent
so simply based off of that information
we could see that raising it from 276 to
350 didn't really increase line pressure
at all so what did this actually do to
the transmission while it's shifting
you're going to see that this
modification really didn't make a
difference we went through and changed
that to 350 PSI was a healthy jump but
when you look at these pressures they're
pretty much the same the line pressure
was the same the clutch pressure was the
same the inertia pressure which is where
we feel our shift occur
even the shape of the patterns they look
pretty much the same so
going through and doing an adjustment a
simple loan adjustment to the max
pressure B box really didn't produce
anything that made the transmission
operating different
so to conclude on max pressure B unless
you're going through and adjusting that
pressure regulator valve lineup by
changing the Boost valve or increasing
pressure to the actual boost valve
or maybe changing the spring tension
that you've got in there it's probably
not worth going through and changing any
of that because you're not we're not
seeing any net result change
so that 276 PSI is pretty much the
pressure that we can get the line
pressure we can get unless we go in
there and modify the transmission so
we're getting more line pressure I think
you're best off leaving that value alone
so our next modification is the maximum
clutch value
see we altered that right there from 218
PSI to 300 PSI so the maximum clutch
pressure is going to be adjusted by
these regulator valves that specifically
control the pressure to the clutches if
you remember from lecture one
little chain of command is AFL pressure
goes to the solenoids solenoids pulses
modulate and they control pressure to
the pressure control valves the pressure
regulator valves for the clutches
there's a lot a lot of things in line
there and that's probably why there's so
many different little presets here if
you will probably call these presets
because they're my opinion are telling
the computer the values of these things
so in general this is probably and this
is my opinion this is probably letting
the computer know what the maximum
pressure is from those pressure
regulator valves that are coming
from the pressure regulator valves
related to the clutches not the main
line pressure regulator valve but the
clutch regulator valves now most of
these regulator valves are controlled
they have a boost valve and then a
regulator valve and they're all
controlled by a solenoid that solenoid
operates basically delivers to those
regulator valves between zero and Max
AFL which is you should say 110 PSI
um the 2 6 regulator valve is a little
bit different it kind of has its own
little system it doesn't have a boost
valve so its pressures might not follow
that same format
so along with what I was saying before
here's my little theory if we adjust the
pressures higher you might actually end
up with a lower pressure
so now my theories haven't necessarily
been true because we haven't been left
with lower pressure but so far we've
been left with pretty much no change so
we'll see if this actually follows along
that same format
by looking at the results of this just
like the past test my theory wasn't
actually panning out to be true
the pressures didn't actually lower I
mean it did a little bit on these but
not significantly
and you'll find that the 40 throttle
position our our line pressures and our
clutch pressures are pretty much the
same nothing really changed there the
inertia pressures really didn't change
that much either maybe a couple PSI some
in some cases it was a couple PSI higher
in some cases lower so I if you're
really interested in this I suggest you
download that presentation from the
automotivetextbook.com site and you can
see all the different results for every
shift
now as far as the wide open throttle run
is concerned I actually did get like the
the line pressure and the clutch
pressure is pretty much the same
but the inertia phase I actually got
about a four PSI gain where it
transitioned at towards the end of the
inertia phase compared to the Baseline
so the Baseline is going to be located
here if you review those
and then the modifications can be here
see with these images you'll be able to
see not only by comparing these charts
what the Baseline values were and what
the modified values were but you can
kind of take a look at that shape of
that pattern or that pressure rise to
see if there is some
you know
definite changes in the modification on
how the computer might be adjusting
pressures a little bit differently now
this next modification was the maximum
line pressure and these you click on
this box and you gain these tables and
what I did is I multiplied this whole
table by 30 percent so I put 1.3 in
there in that box highlighted the whole
table by clicking that box there and I
click multiply
and that raised everything 30 percent so
I figured that would be a substantial
enough change now if you look at the
values though
before I change anything there were
109.9 going back it's like okay what's
109.9
oh that's AFL pressure it's got to be
because if that's a maximum pressure
it's not the Max transmission pressure
we just saw they were in the 270s so
looking at this you're like okay
if I've got 109.9 or 110 PSI
well that sounds like AFL pressure
and so what we did is we changed those
numbers and boosted them by 30 percent
you know really the thing about is if
you understand that the AFL is the
maximum about 110 maybe 120 PSI that by
changing that value we're really not
going to go through and change anything
other than we're going to make the
computer work through a different set of
parameters so it would be interesting to
see how the modifying those tables will
affect the way this transmission
operates
and this is the little breakout right
here it says max line pressure versus
RPM versus gear maximum line pressure in
each gear in relation to engine speed
so it sounds like something that
somebody might want to boost so that way
they can get a little bit more line
pressure let's see what happens
let's see how these results changed and
you'll actually find out that it did in
fact increase pressure increase line
pressure
and when we measure the minimum
pressures that we were getting we were
down near roughly 69 PSI roughly 70 PSI
and then the maximum on the Baseline was
272. interesting thing is that on the
modified where we raise that Max line
pressure 30 percent we still got a 65
PSI minimum line pressure was just able
to go about 13 PSI higher it was able to
go up to 285.
so I guess by changing that column and
telling it to operate different or the
tables by changing the tables not very
different it's going to operate the line
pressure solenoid in a different pulse
width that operates a little differently
than most solenoids on that one when the
solenoids turned on you actually get
less pressure and the more they turn the
solenoid off the more pressure you get
because they want to fail this
transmission so that way
when if you lost power or if the circuit
opened up you wouldn't want to fail it
to low pressure you'd want to fail at
the high pressure so they make it to the
point where no current through that
solenoid is equal to maximum pressure
and that might be the reason why that
pressure went up to 285 and the line
pressure Max like I said earlier it
didn't doesn't really operate off that
pressure it's just like that when you
first key this thing on and really
before any of these shifts occur
I don't know if it's purging air or
doing whatever but you'll see them Spike
up to Max and then it'll go down to a
kind of a usable pressure
so the overall results from this found
that if I adjusted that MAX Line table
and I increased it 30 percent like I did
in my example yes it did increase the
maximum line pressure somewhat didn't
increase at 30 percent but it did boost
it
but here's the thing is it didn't affect
when we went through and checked it
checked the individual shifts and
compared Baseline to the modification we
actually found that the shifting
pressures the releasing pressures and
the applying pressures and then the
overall pressures that the clutches were
left with
they really didn't change so the only
thing that we did change was that
ultimate maximum line pressure which
isn't even being used to the clutches or
during shifting so if you were to go
through and change just that you
probably won't notice it while you're
shifting down the road because
it doesn't ever use that Max Pressure
during Wall Street that true max
pressure while shifting so an overall
summary of all these modifications
adjusting the max pressure MAX Pressure
B and clutch pressure and MAX Line
pressures they won't increase the
pressure during the shifts none of them
really increase the pressure during the
shifts I guess Max clutch pressure
changed it just a slight amount and I
mentioned that here Max clutch resulted
in a little bit higher inertia pressures
it didn't increase line pressure or
clutch pressure it just raised that
inertia pressure a few PSI it won't
increase the what I call the steady
state pressures steady state would be is
when you're driving down the road and
you're in a gear and they have that
clutch pressurized so it won't slip it
didn't change those values at all either
so really all of these changes that we
looked at today
they probably should accompany if you're
going to go through and tweak those they
probably should accompany the internal
modifications or any changes that happen
to the valve body to increase or
decrease pressures through spring
changes or valve changes or so forth now
that finished MAX Pressure Max Pressure
B Max clutch MX line the next one is
going to be the XYZ shift pressures and
adaptive oncoming and adaptive off-going
so keep your eye out for that one
so now if you download this presentation
you'll actually be able to see what
happens on all these different shifts
with the summary table
showing the values for each one
that's what you'll find the specifics on
with the download I just didn't really
want to cover all of that because the
video would be like and I trust me I
recorded one already and it was over an
hour I'm like nobody's going to watch
this so I went ahead and just said I'm
going to make a summary and if you want
you can download the presentation and
you can view and interpret those results
any way you want
so there you have it I will see you on
the next one   another one to add sir 
You said:
now here we are at part four of this
seven part series on HP tuning what does
it actually change in the 6l80
and in this one we're going to look at
the upshift XYZ patterns adaptive
oncoming and adaptive off-going
on this slide it's like a table of
contents for the videos that are in the
series part one was an intro and I
covered the stuff that you needed to
know to understand all these other
videos things like pressure regulation
and AFL pressure and the different
internal parts and the clutches and so
forth and then part two is Baseline
observations just things that we noticed
when we did the Baseline test what was
unique what were some things that were
interesting to point out part three is
the max pressure MAX Pressure B Max
clutch and max line I went through and
changed those and we viewed whether or
not the pressure's actually changed like
you would probably think they would and
in part four I went through XYZ adaptive
oncoming and adaptive offgoing we change
those calibrations and try to see what
kind of pressure changes actually happen
in the transmission
part five is torque Adder transition
time desired output torque Factor part 6
deals with the torque converter clutch
we got all these different things like
the apply ramp and the pressures
regulator gains and offsets for the
torque converter and part seven is the
Adaptive oncoming volume preset and then
results from a commercially available
tune and we'll kind of look to see how
those pressures change based off of
their settings so the first modification
that we're doing in this video is we're
modifying XYZ 30 percent so I'm taking
all these tables under XYZ and all these
different options and I'm raising it 30
so highlight the table and then I put
1.3 in there and multiply the table by
1.3 that raise everything 30 percent
and XYZ is going to represent different
types of shift patterns and you can see
the selections that I've got well
they're all selecting X so they're all
using the same I went ahead and changed
all of them anyway because I figured uh
why not
the way HP tuners explains what's
actually happening if you read down
there it says base shift pressure 2-4
that was the example on for pattern Z so
the two four I that's the one I was
hovering over this is the base line
pressure Main Line Feed pressure
solenoid during a shift kind of gives
you an idea that it's going to control
the line pressure during the shift now
things that are kind of misleading or
confusing is the solenoids are operating
between 0 and 110 or 130 PSI because
they're fed with AFL pressure and you
can see by these values here these are
the stock values that they're going way
above that so this must be the actual
pressure that's being controlled by the
regulator valves for the clutches or a
pressure regulator valve for the line
pressure
so likely when you modify this if you
were to assume that you're going to
actually end up changing the actual
pressures at the clutches if you will
and the way they all end up doing that
is by manipulating the duty cycle of the
solenoid so we'll see by raising these
commanded pressures if you will if we
actually get the net result so here are
the results and the results are
significant there were some changes that
occurred you can see here I've got the
Baseline file with the Baseline
pressures I kind of summarized all the
different pressures so that way we don't
have to look at individual slides and
you can view these individually like I
said if you download the PDF and you
just kind of read through it and this is
the modified and you can take a look
I've got like 255 PSI
on the one two three four clutch and
then the two six clutch really didn't
change that much just stayed at 170. and
then my three five R went up to 242 Mi
456 went up to 188 comparing that to the
Baseline we went from 212 to 255.
168 to 170. that really didn't change
that much only one up a couple PSI
197 it went up to
242 from 197 and
153 on our Baseline for our 456 and 188
on our modified so you can see the
pressures went up and those were the
pressures that occur after the shift is
completed so then you're wondering okay
what are the pressures like during the
shift so if we were comparing like you
know here's our one two shift we went
from 18 PSI to 43 that's when the shift
occurred and then right when it's done
it jumps up to 170. same thing kind of
holds true here for the three five R 37
to 44 that's that shift phase and then
jumps up to a holding pressure 46 to 52.
so these are all the pressures after the
modification was done the actual
shifting pressures if you will
now if we compare that over here to our
Baseline
actually not any different 19 to 44
versus 18 to 43 33 to 41 38 to 41 versus
37 to 44. slight change there
then 41 to 52
46 to 52 so the starting point was a
little bit lower but there weren't
really that many significant changes for
the shifting portions but quite a bit
for the when the shift is complete and
you're just holding it with pressure
so it did change things it changed the
overall pressure it changed the pressure
that the clutches are going to receive
while you're in that gear but it's not
really changing your shifting pressure
so much
at wide open throttle more of the same
thing we're going to see like here's our
Baseline so we've got 217 168 188
and we went from 251
170 226.
I didn't get the three four and all that
stuff because I can't go that fast
at least I don't want to go that fast
with the truck I've gone I'll cars blow
up or anything like that
it's an older truck it's a low mileage
truck but it has original everything so
the tires even the engine oil is
original it's pretty bad
probably shouldn't say that
and looking at our shifting pressures we
went from 12 to 60
to 16 to 65 I guess it did go up a
little bit there and then 39 to 62
actually went down 38 to 59 after we
modified it so long and short of it it
did do quite a bit of changes but it
really did it on the holding pressures
the the line pressure after the shift is
complete unless so on the shifting
pressures while the shift is occurring
so to summarize this XYZ table is
altering these values we can raise and
lower these pressures it can raise and
lower the clutch holding pressures of
the torque holding pressures the
ultimate maximum pressure but it doesn't
seem to change the actual clutch
shifting pressures that much so it's not
going to necessarily change the feel of
the shift but it will hold the clutch on
tighter once the shift is complete
so it might be a good modification to do
maybe in conjunction with other things
if you've increased the power output of
your engine to basically make sure that
this clutch doesn't slip so the next
modification I did
was I increased the Adaptive oncoming
pressures by 36. so what is the Adaptive
oncoming pressure
and this is all my opinion if you read
their description it says shift adapt
pressure preset pressure one two
oncoming pressure preset for the one two
shift and they give you a few different
values so you're like well what do these
values represent is if you remember when
we looked at the shift phases in part
one and then even the observations and
pretty much all these videos there's
different phases to the shift we'll see
the fill phase and the torque phase that
usually takes up about roughly a third
of the shift and then there's the
inertia phase which pretty much almost
completes the shift and then at the end
there's this torque holding which is
when the pressure just goes up to
whatever the clutch pressure is the
maximum clutch pressure now this is just
my theory I don't know if it's true or
not so take it with a grain of salt
maybe you guys can comment and tell me
if you see something know anything
different but this is the way I
interpret it is this first what they
call pressure zero is going to be the
fill pressure so when we look at the
pressure curve the very first part of
the of the clutch application pressure
change there is going to build the fill
phase and it's a relatively low pressure
and then the next phase is going to be
what the and this is my opinion what the
pressure is going to end up on the
inertia so it's either going to end up
as low as 29 PSI or 20 or 30 PSI in this
example as and as high as roughly 60 PSI
and I'm assuming that one would be like
a very low throttle low torque output
and two might be wide open throttle or
highest torque output so when we look at
that slope where it's climbing up it
could go as low as from 11 to 29 or it
can go as high as 11 to 60. that's my
theory and you can look at that for all
the different shifts
is it true well I don't know
um you know here are the examples I got
now this is 40 throttle so we wouldn't
expect this number to be the lowest
because I'm still got quite a bit of
torque coming out of here so changing
that value took it so I got 11 as my
fill I started at 19 roughly and I like
I said it's hard to tell I don't know if
the inertia phase started here or if
it's starting right here but I'm just
identifying some of these pressures so
if you've got a different opinion you
can see at least what that pressure is
but 11 and then it went as high as 44
before it jumped up to the full clutch
pressure
and after the modification it went to
this it stayed at 11. and then it
climbed up
to 51 and then went to full pressure
that was at 40 throttle at wide open
throttle we started 11 and it climbed up
to 60. I'm not really including that
little Spike there so it's going from 11
to 60 and then after the modification it
went from 10 to 63. so it really didn't
climb that much it did climb a bit with
the 40 throttle but quite honestly that
could just be a variation of my foot
maybe I didn't hold it exactly at
um 40 so that's 11 roughly 30 and
roughly 60. so looking at my Baseline
I did end up getting to you know 44 so
that's somewhere between 30 and 60. I
actually did end up getting to 60. so it
went from 11 to 60 at wide open throttle
which kind of matches what I was
thinking 11 to 60. so maybe I'm right I
don't know
it's a guess because like I said there's
no information and
um it's kind of misleading sometimes and
then I basically added 30 to these but I
didn't get a 30 outcome on this one I
only went up three percent or three PSI
on this one I don't know percentage-wise
that went up but I mean it would
probably be it's less than 10 percent so
even though I raise those values 30
percent didn't really see the net
outcome now is it because it adapted no
I don't think so because the very first
shift that would have happened after the
modification should have been really
high pressure and uh and then it didn't
have a chance to adapt and those weren't
higher substantial substantially if you
view the PowerPoint
if you download the PDF of the
PowerPoint and you go to them I have the
first and last where the first meaning
the first shift after the modification
other than what I call last would be
after it had a chance to adapt now this
is the 2 3 shift so those presets would
be 34 44 and 57 roughly and what was I
actually getting well I my fill
pressures were about 38 so they are you
know they're not 34 so I don't know
we're getting higher fill pressures than
that and then we're transitioning under
40 throttle we won as high as 41.
which is lower than their 44 and after
the modification it went as high as 47
so it did increase
under wide open throttle it went up to
62 which was
higher than the number two I didn't want
as high as 50 actually dropped from the
Baseline didn't go as high so
I don't know my theory is not looking
too good right now but otherwise I
really don't know what these numbers
mean because when you start looking at
like okay what's 74 PSI it would be
around here somewhere so it's close I
don't know if that counts and here's the
three four I don't have a wide open
throttle example for the three four
because
I wasn't able to do a wide open throttle
three four shift without going like 120
some miles an hour didn't want to blow
up these tires so these are the preset
values and it says roughly 30 what is
that 38
56 and 75 and we were at about 38 so
this does kind of go and coincide with
that being the fill pressure
and there's you know maximum of 52
well I don't know we're probably should
be a little higher than that after the
modification it went up really didn't
change at all just went up a PSI so
anyway I don't know if I'm on target
with this with the zero one and two but
I do believe it seems pretty consistent
that zero is in fact the fill pressure I
just don't know if these other two
numbers were where they really fall in
line and represent on this graph so to
kind of continue on with that the
off-going pressures that's going to be
dealing with the releasing clutch
so along those same lines we're going to
release the clutch in different stages
just like when we apply a clutch we've
got The Fill torque inertia are then
holding we're going to have to have
stages for the releasing clutch because
on these synchronous Transmissions you
have to control the releasing clutch
it's just as important as controlling
the apply clutch because I can't let a
releasing clutches drain off immediately
because for a period of time I'm not
going to have any clutch applied and if
I didn't have any clutch applied my
engine would flare and I can't hang that
pressure on too long because if I got
two clutches applied or trying to
operate in two gear ratios at once it'll
bind the transmission up so that's the
reason why when we look at these
pressure curves there's a systematic
approach to releasing the pressure and
applying the pressure so that way they
get a precise perfect shift
it's also why these Transmissions
sometimes have quirky shifts here and
there is because it's pretty easy for a
tie up to occur or for a flare dough
curl curve
so these presets just like we were
talking about on the oncoming clutches
this would have to do with the different
stages of which the pressures are going
to drop off on the releasing clutch now
they have a one-two off going which is
interesting to me because they really
don't have an off-going clutch for the
one too
now the low reverse clutch applies in
this transmission and they help you kind
of launch from a stop and then they
release that clutch before the one two
clutch actually applies because they
have a one-way sprag assembly in there
holding that carrier and they don't need
a clutch to hold it so they don't they
actually do release that clutch but it's
not a releasing clutch that you would
ever feel and they release it before the
shift so maybe they just have that
information there because they do
release the clutch in a systematic
fashion it's just we would never feel it
and this is the clutch releasing so this
is the two six clutch releasing so the
two sixes in Gold we can see it drops to
this point and it'll this is the kind of
neat thing with the pressure transducers
you can see things that are happening in
milliseconds that you wouldn't be able
to see with a gauge if I have mechanical
gauges hooked up so initially that
pressure dropped to 56 and then rebuilt
up to 76 and then you can see there's
this controlled release and it kind of
levels out here at 38 so I'd almost
called is like you know our our fill
phase on our applying clutches right
here
and then this is kind of what the
releasing clutch is doing while
the applying clutch is filling and then
this phase right there is when they're
releasing the clutch and that actually
is the torque phase and that is when
most that shift occurs and in reality
that would be the inertia but I've been
kind of combining this all into one and
then it kind of hovers out here at this
pressure here until that shift is
complete so I've really broken this down
I don't know if this is a legit
breakdown in the different phases but
this is what I'm going with the very
initial phase is really going to drop
you down to a certain pressure where
they're going to control the release of
the clutch what I call phase two here
and then phase three and then this one
here is just kind of a drain back if you
will the clutch is fully released at
this point the stage four so this is
like a prep phase and then these two and
three are going to control the rate of
the clutch release so that the ratio is
controlled properly and then four is
more of a kind of a drain back or relief
phase where they empty out that clutch
assembly
my opinion I haven't seen anywhere
published where they've described the
different phases of an off-going clutch
but this is pretty consistent amongst
all the different shifts I can see these
four unique sections in each one of
these clutches as it releases how that
relates to the
different three presets that they've got
let's not really matched perfectly but
what I'm going to have to assume
is that like here I'm just going to
ignore the one two off going because
once again I don't have that tapped for
pressures because we'll never feel that
shift anyway but looking at the 2-3 off
going kind of in an opposite fashion
like the first step of drain back might
be to 60 and then to 43 and then 19. and
what were we actually getting well
this is the Baseline wide open throttle
and at 40 percent
it went from you know this pressure 160
PSI down to 48 or 53 at wide open
throttle then it dropped down to 29 or
24 at wide open throttle and then it
hovered at seven at that last phase four
if you will
then our three four shift
we dropped down to 53 and then 30 and
then 19. pretty consistent this one was
a was a little higher on the wide open
throttle than at 40 percent so I don't
know on this four five it really didn't
match any of those numbers over there
but I guess the big question was is if
you change these values are we actually
raising and lowering these points and
the asked answer is yes so just
basically going off of the two shifts
that we can really account for here
which is the two three and the three
four
Baseline you can see this is what I got
Baseline for uh forty percent this 165
48 24 and then wide open throttle is 162
and my Baseline example
53 29. now modified it by adding 30
percent to the offgoing table and you
can see my 40 throttle went from having
the first step at 48 to the first step
at 76 so that was a big jump
and then my wide open throttle went from
the first step there being 53 to 85. so
it in fact did do a pretty substantial
change when I raise these values 30
percent you can see these are the
numbers that I ended up with here
it actually was a pretty substantial
change now my three four
uh at 40 percent Baseline went from 136
to 53 and then a wide open went from 165
to 62. looking at the modify I didn't
have the wide open throttle to as an
example on this but I went from 129 to
63. so I did do a pretty pretty
substantial climb on my offgoing clutch
so adding pressure to these values right
here
we'll either raise or reduce depending
on which direction you're going with the
the values as you change them the
off-going clutch so if you have a tie up
or a bind you could possibly change
these numbers and maybe get the
off-going clutch to release a little bit
quicker
or maybe if you've got a flare you can
try to get that off-going clutch to hang
on for a little longer so that's how I
interpret these results
so to summarize what we looked at here
today changing those XYZ tables those
pattern tables will increase the clutch
holding Force but it doesn't seem to
affect the actual shifting pressures so
much the Adaptive oncoming when I change
those values for some reason it didn't
seem to change the actual pressures that
much but the Adaptive off-going it
definitely changed those values
especially during the phases two and
three that I kind of identified on the
slides it altered those either by
raising them or lowering them depending
on which direction you would go when you
modify it
so hopefully you got something out of
this video like I said if you go through
the different slides after this if you
download the presentation it will
include all the nitty-gritty details
individual comparison slides more
specific pressures and so forth I just
go through in these videos and I
summarize it so that way you don't have
to listen to an hour video
it could be pretty torturous as I
mentioned in the other videos there's a
whole slew of videos for the 6l80 on the
channel so if you want to learn how to
overhaul it or learn how it works
internally that's the place to go and of
course I want to thank Nick middlebrand
for all of his help he was invaluable in
this process
anyway stay tuned for the next video
which is going to be part five where
we're going to go through torque Adder
transition time and torque Factor
see you soon  here is another to add!
You said:
welcome to part five of the seven part
series on what does HP tuners actually
change when we're going through
modifying some of these calibration
files and in this one we're going to
look at torque Adder transition time and
output torque Factor
we actually learned quite a bit on this
one matter of fact we're going to have
to modify a little bit of our
understanding from part one on how these
shift phases occur because we're going
to dive in and learn a little bit more
about the torque and the inertia phase
of this shift
in the seven part series part one I
cover the intro and some of the basics
that we need to know about how these
Transmissions operate so that way we can
understand what we're changing and then
we went through baseline observations in
part two where we looked at an
unmodified vehicle and kind of got an
understanding of what was going on in
part three we looked at Max Pressure MAX
Pressure B Max clutch and max line that
was all under that General tab
and in part four we did XYZ adaptive
oncoming and adaptive offgoing and now
in this video we're going through the
torque Adder transition time and desired
output torque Factor so we've got two
more part six is going to deal primarily
with the torque converter clutch and
part seven we're going to look at this
adaptive oncoming volume preset and
we're going to go ahead and look at a
commercially available tune
go through and do all their recommended
modifications and see how the how the
transmission reacts after that
and as I mentioned in the other parts if
you are interested in the 6l86 L90
there's a whole curriculum up there on
YouTube on the channel there for this
transmission everything from overhaul to
the theory of operation so if you want
to get into the inner workings of this
transmission or go through an overhaul
one you can learn quite a bit on how to
do that on the channel
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Applause]
so jumping right into it let's see what
torque Adder changes
if you've modified your transmission
before you'll see that a lot of people
suggest going into torque adder and
reducing the shift time that is going to
shorten the time of your shift and
hopefully get you a nice crisper firmer
shift if that's what you're looking
after
and you can see these are the different
tables that we have and what I've done
is I've gone through and highlighted
I've opened up all these tables and I've
multiplied each by 0.7 so I've reduced
the shift time in those tables by 30
percent
and what that does is it actually
shortened up the torque phase if you
remember from part one we've got The
Fill phase the torque phase the inertia
phase and the Final Phase and the torque
phase is when the off-going pressure is
releasing the oncoming pressure is
climbing they're really getting the
torque to apply into these clutches the
ratio necessarily hasn't changed at this
point but we're building up pressure in
our applying clutch and we're trying to
release the releasing clutch so that way
once a releasing clutch is released we
can continue to apply that clutch and
then change the ratio during the inertia
phase
and when we go through and tweak that
table what we're going to do is we're
going to shorten the amount of time that
we spend in that torque phase and we're
also going to for the most part shorten
the overall shift time so if we take a
look at the amount of time it takes when
the solenoid First turns on to when it's
finished that amount of time shortened
up but one of the things that's
interesting is it really didn't affect
the shift pressures where we see on the
scope The Fill pressure and then how
high it climbs to and then you know all
the different steps that it takes those
numbers did not change just the amount
of time it took in those different
phases
so how does HP tuners Define it it says
adds the desired shift time for the one
two shift based on input torque and
engine RPM
of course we don't really know what
desired shift time is so we just
basically get a set of numbers that are
in these tables and if we want a firmer
shift if you decrease that amount of
time you should get a little bit firmer
shift but remember this is happening
during the torque phase
now in this video you're going to see
that I'm going to tweak a little bit of
my description on how these shift phases
occur initially if you remember back to
part one
uh during the intro video I talked about
the different phases that the shifts
occur and we looked at a patent that GM
had and and even Ford and so forth but
this is where I got a bunch of that
information from this is an open
research paper scientific reports
research on shifting process control of
automatic transmissions and in here they
had some descriptions but this is one of
the illustrations that they had and it's
kind of similar to like what we've been
looking at you can see there's the fill
phase there's the torque phase inertia
and then Final Phase it's like okay
that's pretty straightforward and that's
kind of what I've been basing some of my
information on because when we do these
tests sometimes there's not a clear cut
you should see a kind of a pressure
Glide and rise and there's no clear-cut
division between these different
sections so I was guessing a lot well
now after going through and adjusting
this torque adder and changing the
torque phase I've got a pretty good idea
of what the torque section of the shift
is so that's why I'm tweaking adjusting
some of my explanations a little bit
here so here initially I saying okay
well that's the fill phase and that's
identified as a torque phase you can see
that's rather short and then the inertia
phase is long well in the case of this
GM transmission The Fill phase is pretty
consistent in its length and the torque
phase is actually fairly pretty
consistent too but now that I've changed
it I can actually see that division a
little bit easier and you'll see what I
mean here in a second
so as I was saying I got a clearer
picture so our our shift that kind of
went from this
where it was a little bit of the fill
and then I was kind of calling that the
fill and the torque and then this whole
section is the inertia and that is the
final
I don't think that's the case at all I
think just the very beginning is Phil
then the torque is somewhere here and
then inertia is there and once I've
modified it you can see it you can see
that fill pressure right there but then
look at that this section right here
shows the torque and since I've changed
that there's this dramatic change at
occurred of course I call it dramatic
it's only 5 PSI but that change right
there is now really outlining what the
inertia phase is compared to the torque
phase compared to the fill phase and it
really goes to show because when we
describe what's happening during the
torque phase we're saying the off-going
pressure is coming off
and the oncoming pressure that clutch is
starting to apply torque to it this is
when the engine speed drops during a
shift and then by a time that off-going
clutch is off you're in your inertia
phase and that's when the ratio changes
occur
so this really shows the torque phase
the inertia phase really well
so in these documents I actually modify
my tables a little bit from the way we
were doing it before now instead of the
table saying fill in torque and then a
separate section on inertia in a
separate section on Final fill
I've got filled by itself and then I
created a torque and inertia section of
the table and then still have final fill
and if I could tell where there's a
clear division between the torque and
the inertia I separate I put those all
those numbers in there and I put it I
separate with the slash if I can't tell
where there's a clear Division I just do
it like I was doing before and just kind
of combine torque and inertia phase
together
really you could tell by looking at the
off-going clutch to get an idea of one
that Division and that change occurs but
if this is a smooth line or or an
unnoticeable change I would just say
that's the beginning pressure and that's
the end pressure if I could tell where
there is a Division I would say that's
beginning this is the end of the torque
slash beginning of the inertia end of
the inertia
so to include all that information in
the table so you'll see a little
difference if you've been looking at
these tables and digging in a little bit
deeper downloading the PDFs all that
good stuff so anyway just want to
mention that
so when you're in there and you go
through and open up all these different
tables this is what it looks like and
this is the original setup here this is
the Silverado on modified and then what
I've done is I put 0.7 in the Box
highlight the whole table and I multiply
everything by 0.7 and that ends up
reducing everything 30 percent and this
is the you know the end result so what I
should see if everything's working
properly and then after this
transmission is adapted that torque
phase should have been reduced roughly
30 percent and
and it actually did so this showed up
really well on these pressure graphs and
for example here we've got the Baseline
of a one two wide open throttle shift up
top and the same shift after it was
modified on the bottom
and you can see I've gone through and
put my vertical rulers there I'm bait
this is a not the complete shift this is
showing when pressure started Rising
after the fill up to the spike
but you can see that total amount of
time did reduce it went from 704 to 634
so it was pretty substantial of a
reduction there
you can imagine where that time went it
came off the torque portion and then
this was
looking at pretty much just the torque
phase when I could tell
there is a division between the torque
and the inertia
the Baseline was 554 454.
big block Chevy 454 milliseconds
and the modified after doing the 30
percent decreasing 30 percent of the
torque Adder I ended up at 383
milliseconds
small block Chevy so I went from a big
bike Chevy to small bike Chevy so that
is the amount of time right there that
it went to
and the Baseline was up there so that
was my reduction because if I look at my
inertia phase it didn't change at all I
went from 250 to 251 so my inertia phase
didn't really change my torque phase did
change which was expected because we
reduced everything by 30 percent and
then my total shift time not including
the fill it changed because of the
reduction that occurred in the torque
phase after the modified file the reason
why I mentioned that total thing is
because it's not like it lengthened any
of the other periods it just basically
shortened just that one phase which is
the torque face and that's what we
expected and it actually did it
and this is another example right here
this is my Baseline up top here two
three shift wide open throttle got
Baseline compared to
the modified file here you can see the
reduction in that total shift time 616
to 541 but you can see there's a pretty
substantial reduction
of looks like a 67 milliseconds
between the Baseline and the modified
file for the torque portion and then the
inertia portion is pretty close to the
same there's a measured a little shorter
amount of time on the inertia on the
modified file versus the Baseline file
but that honestly could just be a
measurement error that I had either way
my point is is that there was a
reduction in the majority of that
reduction occurred during the torque
phase
another interesting observation was that
for the most part the shift pressures
did not change so I really shrunk that
torque phase but the actual pressure
points 9 PSI for the fill 53 PSI before
it went to that final transition and you
know pretty much going from that 9 to 53
is that what the torque and the inertia
phase did and then same thing with uh
this is the 3-4 that was occurring when
we compared these numbers if you
actually download the PDF and you take a
look at the amount of time that was
spent and the pressures that occurred
you'll see that there's very little
change in these pressure points where
the pressure built up to nine and you
know under wide open or at 40 throttle
and at that the measurement points that
I had they just Shrunk the time but they
didn't increase any of the pressures
they're going to rely on other
tweaks or calibrations that you're going
to do in other tables to give you your
pressure changes this is just going to
focus on the time for that one portion
that torque portion right there of the
shift
so in summary yes the torque Adder does
actually change the amount of time that
we spent in that torque phase that's
kind of what it was supposed to do
and
But realize there are other phases of
the shift there's the fill phase torque
phase inertia and then final fill the
other key part of that is the inertia
phase because if you remember the torque
phase the amount of time that we spend
releasing the off-going pressure and
applying the oncoming pressure but there
the ratio change is really occurring
during the inertia phase
now for the next couple modifications we
actually need to go backwards and go to
shift General and look at the inertia
Factor profile the inertia Factor
profile is a table that shows you engine
RPM and shift torque and assigns a
number to that that's going to be a
number that other tables reference
so like for example these next two
tables that we're going to be talking
about and here the the way HP tuners
defines it is they say the inertia
Factor references other tables at a
given engine speed in driver demand
torque this allows calibration of the
shift feel
so with that known and because these
next two modifications are going to
reference these tables here it's
basically it's a lookup table for a
lookup table
and by just referencing a torque Factor
number they're already going to know
that they're going to fall into this
torque in RPM category so you'll find in
these next like for example transition
time the next one we're going to talk
about here
they are going to reference the shift
and then whatever torque inertia Factor
profile you're in and then it's going to
assign a number to it so basically it's
saying that if I've identified number
four right here as this RPM and that
amount of torque every time I'm in there
I'm in that factor profile and then when
I'm in that factor profile
I'm going to multiply my transmission
time transition Time by that at least
that's the way I understand it so we're
going to see if there's any
modifications that occur in those tables
how they end up affecting that
transmission operation let's see what
happens
[Applause]
[Music]
so what is transition time you can see
there's our tables right there we went
in there and opened up our tables and
multiplied them by 0.7 that reduced the
amount of transition time that occurred
through these experiments we found out
that that transition time actually
reduced the amount of inertia time
during the shift I don't know why they
don't call it inertia time the torque
Adder we learned decreased the torque
phase it appears at this transition time
decreases the inertia phase so it's kind
of nice also kind of like the torque
Adder it changed the total amount of
solenoid time shift time if you will
and but without adjusting the torque
portion just the inertia portion and
just like the torque Adder the shift
pressures stay mostly the same so our
maximum clutch pressure our fill
pressure and our transition pressures
are our different points pinpoints there
those pretty much stayed the same it was
just the timing that changed in these
shifts during the shifts
and this kind of illustrates those shift
points are pretty much the same the
pressures from the Baseline and what
really focus here primarily on that
inertia and torque phase because that's
the shift feel that we actually
recognize but you'll notice that the the
pressures really didn't change
substantially at all or anything at all
a little bit more of a change here on
the 2 3 shift but
very little you could tell that the the
gist of this modification is dealing
with the time of the shift and here we
could see the Baseline up on top
and the modified file on the bottom the
total amount of shift time did change
although not dramatically but it did
change and you can see here the actually
it shows the modified file had a little
bit higher
torque phase if I measured it correctly
but you could also see that there is a
reduction in that inertia phase
so overall a little bit less shift time
and the majority of that shift time
change was occurring on the inertia
phase in this example here is our 2 3
shift wide open throttle and we went
from 616 to 570 so not a huge change in
time
uh 366 to 368 almost identical on the
torque phase and then the majority of
that drop was right there on the inertia
phase went from 250 to 191 milliseconds
so it's really good to know that that
transition time is really more of an
inertia time adjustment doesn't change
pressures but does change the shift time
during those settings
[Applause]
[Music]
in our 11th modification is the
decreasing the output torque factor 30
percent so you might ask yourself what
is output torque factor and don't ask me
because I don't know I don't fully
understand this one your guess is as
good as mine could not figure this out
there was not any changes when we
modified this 30 percent I did not see
any change in pressure shift points or
anything like that the way HP tuners
defines us as this value defines the
desired torque profile as the shift
progresses then when you actually look
at these values that are out there they
vary between zero and negative numbers
and positive numbers and they're really
not a clear indication of what's
actually changing or happening so I went
through and did the test and kind of did
my analysis like I've been doing on all
the other ones you can see the max
pressures the clutch pressures the
amount of shift time the pressures at
the different points really nothing
changed
and same thing here with the three four
shift
you can see I've got basically went from
41 to 52 to 43 to 53 PSI so your
negligible change really that occurred
there
the Final Phase they both ended up 152
PSI
very little change on these you could
download the PDF and see what happened
to all the shifts if you want but I was
not able to come up with a a good idea
of what what this modification changes
now as somebody mentioned the comments
before maybe this modification needs to
accompany a different modification for
it to really be effective that is a
possibility I haven't done combo
changes I want to go through and see if
any one item makes an effect like some
of these things as we've seen do make an
effect but this one here did not make an
effect on the transmission pressures
whatsoever
oh well
now looking at it as far as the pressure
curves are concerned we've got only a
five millisecond measured time
difference there exactly the same torque
phase you know with 12 milliseconds of
the difference of the inertia phase
on the 2 3 the numbers aren't as close
but I don't necessarily think it was the
modification that I did that change that
you can see it was a little quicker of
amount of a total amount of time that
occurred on the shift a little bit
quicker on the torque phase and a little
bit quicker on the inertia phase but
like I said that was probably more of a
anomaly or variation that just naturally
occurs in the testing process
and to summarize
these three tests really helped me
understand those torque phases quite a
bit so I really enjoy going through and
studying these pressure graphs because I
got a better understanding how this
transmission works because of that and
we learned that torque Adder does in
fact decrease the torque phase of that
shift and the transition time does in
fact decrease if you reduce these
numbers of course decrease the inertia
phase
I as well as many people probably
believe that when you were in that Torq
editor mode and you were changing the
amount of time that you were just
assuming that you were adjusting the
actual shift time so if you put 400
milliseconds in there you're changing it
to 400 milliseconds if you put 200
milliseconds in there you were changing
it the shift time to 200 milliseconds
that is not the case you're actually
only changing that one portion that that
one phase of the shift so if you wanted
to go through and adjust this and kind
of get the
best shift possible you might want to go
through and do a little combo change
between torque and inertia I didn't find
that that output torque Factor changed
anything so if you have any experience
with the output torque Factory if you
know what it's supposed to do or if it's
supposed to work in combination with
something else please comment so that
way we can get a better better
understanding of the output torque
factor and what it actually does and as
you can imagine a lot of work goes into
this I do want to thank Nick he helped
me out quite a bit this whole semester
past semester and spring semester of
2023 we went through and had our 2014
Chevy Silverado on the dyno we burn
three tanks of gas and probably uh half
of the tire uh back on the back of the
dyno so and he was the dino man
it was dynomite
so as I mentioned Automotive textbook
that's where you go to download the PDFs
of these tests
of course I forgot to mention you can
also download the actual log files and
the Pico files and there's links to the
programs so that way you can download
the programs and view those for free
so you get all kinds of information
there related to these tests
automotextbook.com and the next one
we're going to cover is going to be
torque converter clutch all the stuff
that goes to the torque converter clutch
application including slip speed
regulator and offset and Max Pressure
all that stuff everything related torque
converter is going to be in the next
video so I will see you there   and another sir! 

You said:
hello and welcome to part six on this 6l80 6 L90 HP tuners what does it change
and in this one we're going to be focusing on the torque converter clutch we're going to look at the modifications
for desired pressure apply ramp max pressure regulator gain and regulator offset so this video is pretty long it's
about an hour long and a lot of it at least in the beginning is talking about how the torque converter works in the
6l80 and I feel it's pretty important to for you guys to understand how the Hydraulics Opera in this transmission so
I focused the very beginning of this presentation here on the inner workings of the torque converter clutch so if for
some reason you already know all that stuff you can look at the time stamps and the description and jump ahead but I
do recommend if this is new to you that you watch the beginning of this so that way get an understanding of how the
Hydraulics work for this torque converter circuit and this is all part of a seven-part series as I mentioned
and the introduction part one is one I recommend that you watch first because it covers how this transmission operates
from a hydraulic and electrical perspective and then part two focuses on
the stock configuration what pressures we had in this transmission and the stock configuration part three four five
six and seven those all include the modification so here we are at part six looking at the torque converter clutch I
recommend you look at some of those other videos so that way you can see what some of the other modifications do to this transmission and if you go to
the channel you'll see there's a lot of of videos on the 6l80 up there everything from overhaul to mechanical
electrical and hydraulic operation and even using the transo shift kit the tow and pro shift kit we did an analysis of
that so head over to the channel if you're interested in some more of the 6l80 6L 90 content so let's take a look
at all the different things that we can modify for the torque converter in HP tuner so if we click on the torque
converter Tab and then we click on the general tab this is the basic layout that they've got available for us now we
are going to modify some of these settings over here and uh kind of go through and document the pressure
changes that occur with those changes but I will like to note that this section right here this regulator gain
regulator offset isn't available on every vehicle I've downloaded from the
HB tuners repository a bunch of different stock tunes and open them up and for some reason this isn't listed on
certain Vehicles another thing sometimes this minimum slip acon isn't
listed and also this section right here earlier Vehicles earlier units had this
setup where you could tell the torque converter clutch would adapt over time but at some point they ended up like
reversing or changing these numbers in here and like the torque minimum at 66
and the torque maximum at uh 15 the way that's set up this transmission is never
going to adapt to the torque converter because those pressures obviously if the minimum is higher than the maximum that
pretty much prevents this torque converter from adapting so I thought that was kind of interesting now we
TCC Hydraulic Operation
before we get too deep in here we should probably understand a little bit of how this torque verter operates and if you've if you don't know anything about
torque converters and you want to learn about them I do have some videos up on my channel uh I've got a basic video
that teaches you how the torque ver operates but then there's specifics on the 6l80 and the hydraulic and
mechanical presentations but in a nutshell what ends up happening this is our torque converter our torque
converter is a disconnect between the engine and the transmission it's a fluid coupling so the fluid from the impeller
portion is going to throw fluid over to this turbine portion and that's going to deliver torque to the input shaft going
into the transmission but once you get to a certain point this is a disc right here that
applies the input shaft that connects the input shaft to the torque converter cover locks it up so now my engine will
directly Drive the input shaft they do that for fuel economy and uh even in
this transmission this torque clutch come on pretty quick even at wide open throttle and first gear they apply that
torque converter clutch the way they do that is the fluid that's between the piston in the cover they vent that fluid
off and then the fluid pressure that they fill the torque converter with is going to apply that piston up against
the cover so like I said here's the Piston going from one side to the other
and when they move that towards the front of the vehicle they have pushed that up against the cover and the cover
is just as you can see kind of outlin lined right there so when they have that hydraulic pressure pushing up against
this cover they're going to lock the transmission's input shaft to that cover and I should use the term lock Loosely
because they slip this converter on purpose so the pressure that they put on this side on the transmission side of
the converter piston is going to be the apply force that pushes that uh torque
clutch up against the cover and you can see that's all kind of this reddish fluid that comes this
comes from the store converter clutch regulator valve so this line pressure from the transmission as it gets
regulated in I show it the same color but it it isn't the same as line pressure so that's probably not the best
color to to use maybe a a lighter like a pink would probably be better and then
that passes through this torque converter control valve becomes this torque converter apply pressure so
that's basically what they're doing this torque clutch regulator valve as its name implies is responsible 100% for
creating the pressure that is going to be applying that torque converter over there this torque converter control
valve right here is just basically saying I'm in the apply mode or the release mode it's not regulating the
pressure to the converter it's just either directing apply pressure to the apply side or it's directing converter
pressure to the release side and releasing the fluid um or releasing the converter
clutch so the way this regulator valve operates is is it's going to balance on
one side we're going to have the solenoid solenoid fed with actuator feed limit pressure and that's about 120
PSI that's covered in the intro lecture you should probably watch that if you don't know anything about that and the
and the pressure coming from that solenoid when that solenoid turns on it gets split off in the two directions
comes over here and shuttles this torque converter control valve and it also comes over here pushes on the end on of
pushes on the end of the regulator valve that allows line pressure to enter into the supply circuit if you look that line
pressure which now they're calling regulated apply pressure that also has the ability of coming around here to the
end of this valve so once this pressure builds up enough on the end of its valve it's going to move that valve over and
it's going to block off the line pressure passage so it lets just enough pressure in to the point where it blocks
itself off it keeps doing that like the more solenoid pressure I enter in the
more line pressure will find its way into that regulated apply circuit and it can come around work with this spring
here and help close itself off so that in a nutshell is how this torque converter circuit Works um I know I
blasted through that so if you don't have much background knowledge on how these torque conters operate or how the Hydraulics operate please review some of
those other videos but when we're going through and we're discussing how this torque converter is modified and what
changes in HB tuners I think it is important to know how the system actually operates so if you like to dig
TCC Hydraulic Valve Engineering
in a little deeper I've got a little bit more information on this slide here this shows I measured the amount of force
that's on the spring might be off a little bit here and there but you know I was doing the best I could that force
that we've got on the spring right here kind of dictates the position of this valve and how much pressure it takes to
shuttle the valve over so the end of this valve the torque converter control valve if you remember the control valve
determines whether you're in the apply mode or the release rele mode it doesn't necessarily determine how much pressure
you have in the apply mode that's the job of this regulator Veil but it does take a certain amount of pressure to
stroke this valve over and compress that spring and I measured out uh By the time
this valve is moving just enough to apply fluid pressure into the apply circuit it's at about 2 and a half
pounds which takes about 12 12 PSI across this surface area almost 210 of a
square inch to move that open to to allow that to happen but now normally this valve just fully strokes and it
kind of bottoms out on the boore and it takes about
17.35% have to create before this valve moves over to create regulated apply
pressure well according to my calculations since we have to overcome 3.84 pounds of force to get this valve
to just start to open up to allow line pressure to find its way into the regulated apply circuit the torque
converter clutch solenoids is going to have to build about 24 PSI 24 PSI across
this surface area which is 160,000 of an inch will generate enough Force to
compress the spring to about 3.84 lbs of force that will allow this valve to move over to the point where line pressure
will get into the regulated apply circuit and that's where pressure begins that's the starting point so once that
solenoid delivers about 24 PSI then the regulated apply pressure is pretty much
starting at zero so then they're going to continue to duty cycle the solenoid and uh introduce more pressure in it to
get regulated apply pressure out now the only thing I have tapped in I've gone through and I've tapped into the torque
clutch apply pressure right after this torque converter clutch control valve so we're measuring this pressure that's
finding its way to the torque converter I'm not measuring direct solenoid pressure on HP tuners and on scanners
they are telling you what the torque vertic clutch pressure is so theoretically the same pressure that's
on the scan tool as far as I'm aware would be the same pressure that we're actually measuring in these experiments
now once the pressure drops down to a certain point you'll see that the actual command Ed pressure for the torque
converter clutch solenoid is higher than the actual pressure and I think that has to do with this differential that's
occuring where they are going to maintain say 25 psi or 26 PSI of
solenoid pressure but that's not putting much force on this valve and it might only be generating say8 PSI or seven PSI
of pressure but once the pressure starts building up 50 60 70 80 it seems like
the actual scan tool pressure that's listed Max is pretty close to what I'm
actually measuring with my pressure transducers so I figured that's worth mentioning because yeah this control
valve might stroke at about 15 psi but that solenoid is actually going to have to start delivering well into the 20 psi
range just to generate enough movement of this valve to get line pressure to find its way into the regulated apply
circuit and actually start building apply pressure so here's the torque converter clutch regulator valve it fits
TCC Valve Body Layout
inside this bore right here here goes into the valve body right there the spring goes in first then the valve this
plunger and then this end plug and I've kind of labeled out these
passages right here in blue is where the pressure from the torque converter
clutch solonoid Finds Its way into that valve lineup actually goes between that plunger and that valve right there in
this purple color that's the regulated apply pressure that's the pressure that this valve is ultimately going to be
creating and it starts as line pressure that's what's in Red so when line pressure Finds Its way into this
passageway here that ends up becoming torque verter clutch regulated apply fluid pressure some of that pressure
will find its way around to the back of the valve and join forces with the spring to kind of move this valve over
to the left and when it does that it will close off the passage and won't let any more line pressure into the
regulated apply circuit unless the solenoid increases pressure then it'll move the valve back over to the right
and let more pressure and it finds its way right past this little opening that we have in the
Val so I'll go ahead and get these plugs out of the way for ease of view so this
is pretty much the resting position of this valve when solenoid pressure Finds Its way through that hole pushes this
valve over it's going to open up the passage between line pressure and that regulated apply circuit some of that
fluid that Finds Its way into the regulated ply circuit will find its way back join forces with that valve and
close itself off so as soon as it moves over to this position here it'll block itself off and it won't be able to generate any more regulated apply
pressure unless the selenoid increases its pressure and pushes that valve over more and lets more pressure into that
regulated apply circuit so it's always going to pretty much live in this little position where it's just uncovering the
opening that allows line pressure to go into that regulated apply circuit when
you look at this valve there's actually a little chamfer right there and that's where the pressure will
kind of ease into the circuit as this valve shuttles over now on the pump is where this
TCC Control Valve Pump Layout
torque inverter control valve resides I've went ahead and Mark these passages
as well this Veil fits inside this pump kind of lives in this bore underneath
this uh markings and blue is where the torque ofter clutch solenoid applies its
pressure to so torque clutch solenoid that also regulates the pressure also presents itself to the end of this valve
and and in purple is where the torque converter clutch regulat apply that comes from the pressure regulator the
torque converter clutch pressure regulator it comes in through that purple passage and when this valve moves over far enough and opens up the passage
here that pressure is able to find its way into the torque converter clutch apply circuit so in red is the actual
pressure that goes through the torque converter through through the torque converter apply circuit and that has to compress this spring right there so when
this spring gets compressed when there's enough solenoid pressure on the left side
it will compress the spring move the valve over to allow the regulated apply
pressure to find its way into the torque converter apply pressure circuit it takes about 15 psi overall to move this
valve over substantially enough to open up enough of a gap to get pressure to
find its way into that circuit it just starts uncovering it according to my calculations at about 12 a half PSI and
this is fully stroked over at about 17.35%
that's when there's no obstruction between the regulated apply and the torque clutch apply circuits so then you
ask yourself okay why is this all important why you going through all this background information is because
obviously we're changing something when we're tweaking the values in HP tuners
and it's going to change likely the operation of how that solenoid operates it might even change the programmed
information and how this valve is configured and how this valve is laid out we got certain amount of spring tension here you can see this surface
area right here is a little bit different than that surface area I've got .106 Square in on this end and on that
end I got1 160 so got different sizes um
that ultimately will end up creating a different torque converter clutch apply pressure based off of the actual
selinoid pressure solenoid might be generating a certain amount of pressure but the actual pressure going to the
torque ofter clutch is going going to be different so all that stuff may or may not be related to the
configurations so let's take a look at a few other things as far as this transmission is concerned so I
HP Tuners TCC Variations
downloaded from the HP tuners repository all these different stock vehicles of course you can't really prove that
there's no modifications done to those but as you could see there's uh these are some of the earlier Vehicles like
2010 2011 and you'll see the regulator gain regulator offset you'll see some values here you'll actually see this
regulator gain is going to change on some of the later model vehicles some of the slip speeds are not the same from
vehicle to vehicle you'll find those kind of vary quite a bit and as I mentioned before if you look at some of
the different TCC adapt settings sometimes they'll have things listed anything from zero to 300 for the uh
minimum and maximum torque and uh sometimes like you know you'll see 30
and 10 where they'll defeat the ability for this torque clutch to adapt so it
seems like right around 2012 is when they started to defeat that torque converter clutch adapt by reversing some
of those torque numbers looking at the 2014 2015 16 17 regulator gain and
offset kind of disappeared but then it came back with some different values here we've got 375 instead of the 1.5 so
that changed and then on some of these vehicles you even see a different value for the regulator offset now these are
all the six lers and you could see like way back in 2009 they had the 1.5 and the 27 PSI but then here's the 2015 it
didn't even include any of that regulator gain and offset and then the 2017 we went to that 375 and the uh 27
PSI and kind of following that same format these earlier units they look
like they had the ability of adapting the torque rter clutch but the later units they monkeyed with that minimum
and maximum torque reading so that it didn't have the ability of adapting
I just thought that was kind of interesting these are 6.2 lers and uh notable changes obviously kind of
following along the previous formats but you can even see some of the regulator offset values have actually changed as
well and in this case also we don't have the ability of setting the minimum AC on
Scope BASELINE explaination
slip so what are we looking at we're going through and doing some of these changes as the previous videos shown
I've went through and I tapped in and I'm measuring pressure actually measuring directly line pressure from the line pressure tap and in this case
I've gone into the valve body and I've tapped in to the actual torque converter clutch pressure passage so I'm pulling
actual torque convert clutch pressure and the screenshot here shows me operating from first to fifth gear so
you can see the line pressure changes and then the torque conter clutch kind of builds up pressure and it maintains
its um slip speed at whatever it's set at now that's kind of worth noting here
is that the ultimate goal is to have this transmission slip at whatever the
desired slip amount is so they're going to look at actual slip speed by comparing engine speed and input shaft
speed and they're going to change the pressure in the torque converter clutch to match the desired slip speed so if
the desired slip speed is 20 RPM they're going to manipulate pressure to get 20 RPM of slip and here in lies the problem
is that I have a stock vehicle with no modification having gone through and increased the torque of the engine that
would cause it to slip more I gone through and changed the torque inverter with a different friction lining haven't
put any shift kits in it that alter maybe the spring tensions or valve sizes or anything like that so there's no
modification so me going through and changing some of these values might not yield any result so it's going to look
like some of these things didn't have any effect on the transmission at all when in fact they might have an effect
if I had a modification that I was trying to compensate for that increased torque or a different friction material
so keep that in mind when we're going through this now as far as this pressure graph is concerned in blue I've got line
pressure and you can see it changes and that mimics actually the uh like the 1 two 34 clutch or on the higher gears the
456 clutch we'll see that here in a second where you can even though we're not seeing the shifts you can actually
tell where some of these shifts are occurring and then in red is the torque converter pressure you can see they've got this initial pulse here in the
beginning it's kind of like a prime pulse and that's right when I accelerated you can see line pressure
built up and before they applied the torque converter they actually boosted that pressure up so you know sometimes
up to 160 PSI for a little less than a second and then it drops back down and
then it slowly controls the pressure to get the actual slip to match the the
desired and this is through six gears soon as I got into sixth gear I got off
the throttle so you saw the pressures drop off but that is uh basically what we're going to be looking at here on
these torque converter clutch modifications but I wanted to make sure you guys understand that that techum the
computer the TCM will constantly change the pressure to force the actual slip to match desired and that's what ultimately
drives pressure in this transmission and as I mentioned before you can actually tell where this
TCC vs Gear Overlay
transmission shifted you can see I've got labeled here in a rough fashion here that's first second third fourth fifth
and like right after fifth it's you can't really see it here on the screen but I shifted the sixth gear I mimick uh
kind of overlaid that or roughly put off to the side the clutches that were going on at this point during the shift so I
kind of uh duplicated both of those different scope shots and you know I
could see the different clutches this is all covered in previous videos but you can see at which point the 35r and the
456 and all that stuff turned on and it is kind of directly related to what was going on to line pressure so when line
pressure would spike just before they would do the shift and then while you're in that gear it would apply whatever
pressure it felt it needed and would spike again just before the next shift so you could see line pressure kind of
spiked up before every shift except they really didn't do that between um fourth and fifth and fifth and sixth mainly
because you don't have that much torque multiplication you don't have to worry about slipping your clutch as much but
the point is is that um even though we're not directly measuring the shifts and seeing the shifts they are occurring
pretty much at least the first three shifts are occurring right after the pressure spikes up so kind of keep that
in mind the HP tuners has a really nice scanner as you probably already know and
HP Scanner with TCC and SLIP SPEED info
some of the information that we have available to us for the torque converter clutch is we can look at the slip the
desired slip what the actual pressure is or I shouldn't say actual what the commanded pressure is that's trying to
operate that torque converter and apply it to whatever amount is necessary to
get that slip to match the desired and actual and then we can even see our engine torque so that way we can tell
where we're at on these tables cuz a lot of them will reference engine torque so now this little video here is not in
real time you can see I'm dragging that kind of vertical cursor in by hand I want to point out that right when the
torque ver clutch applies right there they bring up that pressure and even though we have slip listed there at like
100 RPM and the desired is listed at 20 RPM it's actually still fluctuating down
and letting it slip more but that's likely what it's doing during the initial application in low gear so I'm
not certain why the TCC desired slip doesn't register a little higher but then now as you can see it's getting a
little bit further along we're getting that torque clutch slip to come closer to matching that 20 and it varies quite
a bit and that's the reason why the the pressure has got to fluctuate a little bit here and there during that process
so I wanted to point that information out because torque clutch operation is not a precise science they obviously
have tables and logic and methods but when we go through and look at what's happening we see this slip speed and
they don't want just the slip speed to be at zero they don't want to just turn the torque con clutch and have it apply they want this torque conter to slip a
little bit because that's going to dampen out some vibrations it's going to have a smoother operating vehicle
smoother operating transmission so in these low gears like in first and second gear you could see they apply the torque
re clutch and they don't fully apply matter of fact they let it slip more than normal even though this is staying
at 20 hour PM you could see that it pretty much fluctuated around 100 maybe a little under 100 RPM slip until this
next shift occurred and then it dropped it down and was kind of trying to maintain that 20 RPM slip and you could
see a lot of hash there where they do a lot of ping ponging back and forth they look at the slip if it's a little too
high they raise the pressure if it goes a little too low then they lower the pressure they're constantly chasing its tail almost like the fuel system does
when it's trying to maintain fuel control rich and lean rich and lean they wait for an oxygen sensor to read lean
and then they add more fuel then they wait for it to go rich and then pull Fuel and they constantly Chase itself
around like that same thing is happening in this transmission for the torque converter I wanted to point that out and
I wanted to point out that there's so much more that this transmission has to work with you can see I'm at 54 PSI and
I'm doing the 40% Baseline stock configuration but I'm at 40% throttle producing a decent amount of engine
torque yet all I'm needing is around the 50 50 to 60 PSI to keep that torque
converter clutch applied to give me 20 RPM slip so this thing actually has a lot more room a lot more pressure that
it could generate to apply that clutch if it needed to so if you download the
PDF from automot textbook.com you'll see all these different scenarios and operation you'll see graphs similar to
this one this is a baseline 40% you can see they've got this initial pulse for
roughly 4/10 of a second they'll bring it up to over 100 PSI and then you'll see another pulse once I'm actually
cruising on the road you can see when pressure went up I was actually driving the vehicle on the dyno Wheels were
spinning and before they brought the converter on they actually pulsed it
that's about 8/10 of a second and it went up usually over 150 psi and then they brought it right back down to zero
and then they slowly brought that pressure up and that was to control the slip speed on all these different graphs
I also mentioned um how many how much time it took to get to the point where it plateaued out kind of at that first hump
like when it spent a little time you could tell the pressure like in this case was 2.14 seconds it got up to about
52 PSI and then it started doing its little manipulation and regulation so I
mentioned that now at the very end the tail end once we got in fifth sixth gear you can see where the pressure would
usually climb up and then right once I was decelerating it would drop down and I almost always have between seven and 9
PSI on D Cel until I came slow enough to the point where they they released the torque verter clutch so I thought this
was uh kind of in interesting but you'll also see this if you look at the PDF for all the different situations and
configurations here's a recording of a wide open throttle pool you'll actually notice that the torque converter clutch
slip speed is much lower than 20 and then that torque conver clutch pressure climbs up roughly to about 80 81 182
PSI and then I got off the throttle then we went to Del Cel pressure if you
Slip tables in HP Tuners
actually look at the tables they're almost like on this vehicle here the Baseline vehicle they 20s pretty much
throughout for slip speed except for that last row of zero and I'm sure that's the reason why once we were at
wide open throttle the desired slip speed wasn't 20 anymore it wasn't zero either but it
was much closer to zero now in the future I'm probably going to go through and modify that to a higher number
because I'll be curious to see if in fact the actual slip speed does the desired slip speed goes up to 20 or 50
or whatever it is I know a lot of people will modify their vehicles and they will
leave the torque converter clutch off in first second third and fourth gear or they'll leave it off under wide open
throttle situations which is perfectly fine but I also want to go through and verify that if you did do a change that
it would uh in fact give you the desired result so here just pointing out what I
was talking talking about you can see the desired slip started at 20 RPM then it dropped off pretty dramatically once
that engine torque built up to a certain point you can see it's fluctuating anywhere from 4 to 7
RPM and uh that's what the new Target is so they're going to be driving it until
that slip speed actually achieves whatever the desired slip speed supposed to be now look at wide open throttle the
big things that have changed we still see that pulse kind of that 410 of a second priming pulse but we're missing
that 8/10 of a second pulse I guess there's just not enough time to do that because they bring that torque clutch on
pretty quick you can see takes less than half of a second for it to build up to about 60 PSI and then they ramp that up
and it gets up to 84 PSI so under this situation to keep the slip speed where it needs to be under wide open throttle
they needed 84 PSI to do it a recorded an alternate Baseline and if you remember from the other videos the
reason why is because sometimes they had throttle reduction after the modification they had throttle reduction during the shifts and I wanted to
compare apples to apples so I found another Baseline run where they didn't
have throttle reduction and I called that the alternate Baseline so depending
on whether you have throttle reduction or not I've compared it to both the
baselines and you can see there's very little difference I I'll have a comparison here coming up they still
have the pulse and it's about the same pressures and pressure climbs up to about the same amount this one took a
little bit longer maybe it's because there wasn't throttle reduction at all and it slipped a little bit more through
it and then the ultimate pressure actually didn't go as high either so that's kind of you know tradeoff there
but when you compare the throttle reduction versus the no throttle reduction there's very little change so
we got the same amount on diesel our pressure went up to 59 on both of them took a little bit longer without the
throttle reduction but it didn't climb as high by the time the end was done and I still
want to point out make sure it's kind of set in stone and solidified the
pressures that we have during these different portions really are all determin determined by the actual versus
the desired slip they'll have more pressure if there's more slip and they'll have less pressure if there's
less and they're constantly hunting around like that to try to match those two so the first modification that we
First Mod - TCC Desired Pressure
did is we increased the desired pressure by 30% so I took the original table and
I highlighted it and multiplied it by 1.3 and that raised the pressures on everything a few things that were kind
of a little confusing as far as the table's concerned if you look on the top I've got PCA pressure which I have to
believe is the torque rter clutch solenoid pressure PC meaning pressure control a I don't know why a um and that
has it listed in kilop pascals now I changed that to psi the unfortunate thing is I guess it's a glitch with HP
tuners normally it changes the headings on these tables The Columns and the row
headings there but it didn't it kept them in kPa even though I adjusted it based off PSI the Val and and these
numbers are in fact in PSI but the headings did not change so I went ahead and included a few different common
pressures that they have listed here and what they would be in PSI for people that are speaking American like me that
1600 kPa is 232 PSI so that's that's higher than most of our line
pressure is ever going to get and then um 145 PSI is 1,000 kPa that's a pretty
easy number now I pointed out what 800 kPa is because that's around 116 PSI
because that's pretty much what AFL pressure is and that's reason why I point that out is because if this is the
solenoid pressure for torque converter clutch solenoid it'll never go much higher than 800 because it's fed with
AFL and AFL is pretty much regul to about 120 125 psi and then just for um kind of include
the the low end 310 kPa is 45 so where it says line pressure here is basically
saying between 45 PSI and 232 PSI and
then Zer PSI to like 116 PSI now this is
what as you can imagine is what HP tuners Identify say the torque conver clutch desire pressure is the torque
converter desired pressure and as I mentioned I increased it 30% so my values went from this to that but
this is pretty much where you'll be operating at where I've got this red boxed outline because you're not going to often see
this transmission drop below 70 PSI especially if you are moving down the road or you get giving in a throttle so
70 PSI is 483 kPa so pretty much 500 kPa or
larger and because AFL is limited to 120 even if that solenoid passed 100% of AFL
pressure through it it would probably only go this far so where I've got it outlined in this red box it's pretty
much the normal operating range so the torque converter pressure is a function
of the solenoid pressure working on one side of the valve and then whatever pressure it lets into the circuit
working with a spring on the other side of the valve so there's a it's a balanced valve it will let in as much
pressure as it can until that same pressure that it lets in ends up shuttling the valve over and cuts itself
off so is that what this is determining possibly it's saying that this pressure
that we have right here coming from our solenoids going to end up ultimately creating a pressure in the torque
inverter that is equivalent to what we see here on this table so what actually ended up happening when we did this
change well not a whole bunch matter of fact I can't really say for sure that it really did make a change I'm kind of
going to ignore this purge pulse here because even though they lasted the same amount of time they were at different
pressures but I really don't know if that's uh important at all the I got
8/10 of a second went up to 161 8/10 of a second went to 157 so that was pretty
much the same that little initial pulse that they did at the very beginning then when we dropped at the zero took about
1.9 seconds to go to 60 which is quicker and a little bit more pressure than what it did on the Baseline where it went
from 0 to 52 in 1 2.14 seconds so maybe that is as a result of the modification
if you look it also kind of did a bunch of um camel humps going on there which
in my opinion means it's probably chasing its tail a little bit there and not that might not be desirable here
they had that initial one but this is where that slip would have been a little bit higher if we talk like we were talking about earlier and then it
started to climb up and stabilize here they almost jumped it a little too
quickly a little too hard at first did it again and then they stabilized they
ended up though uh pretty close to the same pressure by the time we were done looking at these with wide open throttle
and how it changed you can see it jumped up to 59 PSI on both the baselines the
alternate Baseline took a little bit longer than the original Baseline the one with throttle reduction now the
modification took roughly 7/10 of a second which was not that much different from the other ones but it did jump up
the 72 psi so kind of like at the 40% throttle it kind of didn't initial climb
climbed a little bit higher than it did on the Baseline um still kind of ended up
around the same pressure but all throughout here the computer is just basically adjusting pressure to match
desired and actual slip so um I think what we're noticing here is that modification did an initial steeper
climb during the acceleration during the initial application so to summarize this
modification I don't really know if it's worth changing these tables doesn't seem to really affect a lot except for maybe
that initial ramp it did seem to kind of go possibly a little quicker but definitely higher so if you had issues
where you felt the torque converter wasn't coming on properly in the very beginning of a shift this might be worth modifying other than that I don't know
if you're really going to notice a change it's still a techum or a TCM that's controlling the pressure to get
the slip that it needs to be as long as it can do that it's seems to be uh under control now the next modification that
2nd Mod - TCC Apply Ramp
we modified was a Ply ramp see it right there under the torque converter clutch pressure so you click on that you get
this table up across the top it says slip RPM error so this is how far off
the slip RPM is from desired and on the side here we've got RPM which I assume is either engine RPM or input shaft RPM
but either way based off of what the err is if let's say for example desired is 20 RPM and I'm getting 40 RPM so that
the difference would be 20 and depending on what my engine RPM is this this is how much pressure they're going to add
to the torque converter clutch to try to bridge that Gap and bring it back down to where it's supposed to be as it gets
closer it would switch over to 10 and then five then once it's perfect it theoretically You' think it'd be zero
and then if it overshoots it it'll subtract a certain amount of pressure so that's what the idea of the ramp is and
if I increase these values it's going to give you more apply pressure to try to
bridge that Gap so if you're going through and you're modifying your engine power your torque output or you know
you've supercharged turbocharged your engine or something like that that under the given tables if they see a slip air
and they're going to apply the clutch with a certain amount of pressure that might not be enough to bridge the gap so you would in fact want to go in there
and raise this ramp so that would bring that slip into where it needs to be there's a bunch of different tables that
help you define what your slip is supposed to be you'll find sections like for example right here where it says minimum slip acon which you would assume
would be what the slip desired slip would end up being but that's not the case as you can see when you're looking
at the scan data it shows 20 RPM it does not show three but then when you open up these other tables like say AC off first
2 third fourth fifth six you'll see your 20 RPM listed so I don't really quite understand why they got AC off I think
that is what your desired slip is going to end up being so you'd want to go through and modify all those tables to
what your desired slip is a lot of people go in there and they zero out all those values so that there's no slip
matter of fact they'll zero out that they'll go in disable displacement on demand slip and they'll also zero amount
even though they don't have to they'll go through and zero out all these DOD tables and then they will Zero out uh if
they have something listed their minimum AC on they'll zero it out as well but if we were trying to keep this thing in a
stock configuration because there's a lot of people that say no I don't want to do that for drivability sake um
they'll leave slip in there and let's say we go through and slip is at 20 we see that listed on our scanner at 20 and
that's what we end up getting now here DOD slip is a little higher they want it to slip more so that way you won't feel
the vibration from displacement on the man when you're operating off four cylinders instead of
eight now it's my opinion that if you go through and just take a stock vehicle and you change the supply ramp you
actually might be doing more harm than good because this thing's programmed with the given engine torque and the
friction material that you've got in your torque conter clutch everything's kind of match if you've gone in there and changed that
value it's likely going to overshoot and every time there's slip error instead of doing the proper
adjustment it might overshoot it and then have to go the other way and then back and forth and maybe that ends up being something you feel which isn't
going to be desirable but if you've gone through and you modified the engine or maybe you rebuilt the transmission and
you're using an aftermarket converter and it's got a different friction material in there so if you've done some
modifications this might be an area where you can go in and fix a possible drivability issue but here on this stock
equipped vehicle as you're going to see here in some of these slides there really wasn't much of a change which I
guess is a good thing because that kind of um goes against my overshooting theory but as far as pressures are
concerned you could see it pretty much maintained so looking at this Baseline
data versus the modified data you'll see that the pressures they went to 52 PSI
on the Baseline at 2.14 and it was pretty much the same a little less pressure and a little longer
time for the modification for it to kind of plateau out there these pressures
here you can see this is kind of what they do early on in the first couple gears kind of maintaining at a little
higher slip speed it does look like it's kind of doing a little bit more although the Baseline shows quite a bit of
movement as well the overall pressure didn't quite climb as high but once again it's doing what it needs to do to
match desired and actual slip now under wide open throttle I've got my two
baselines my normal Baseline and ALT Baseline alt being without throttle reduction and I went from Zer to 60 PSI
in a little less than half of a second and I didn't do too much jig jagging up and down sa around so really this
modification ended up with 86 PSI compared to 84 and 80 with my two
baselines so I don't really know if it was overshooting it I don't think we I created a problem by modifying this but
as you can see there's overall the pressures did not change that much so I don't think it really made any
significant changes in the drivability and the functionality of that torque conter clutch so in summary if you're
continuing to keep slip in this converter and you're not pulling slip completely out I don't really know if
it's worth on a stock configuration going through and adjusting the apply ramp unless maybe you've got some kind
of an issue you're trying to chase so modifying a stock vehicle really didn't yield much of a change if at all now if
you modified the engine or you've gone through and changed the torque inverter and you're going to continue to have slip in that torque converter then it
would probably be worthwhile to go through and tweak that ramp a little bit next we're going to look at torque
Mod 3 - TCC Max Pressure
converter clutch maximum pressure and that's changing that table here you can see it's a single row adjustment added
30% to it so we're raising this MAX Pressure up and the way the HP tuners
defines it it's the maximum allowed pressure of for the torque converter clutch looking at these
values from a stock setting we're going from basically
138.236.128.7 providing pressure to that regulator valve that pressure that lets in to that circuit is going to join
forces with that spring on the end and you're going to be able to get about 145 PSI maximum that's like the limit if you
had that solenoid operated full blast the torque of clutch solenoid operating full blast letting all 120 PSI in there
it's going to find its way over to that regulator valve work with that spring and it's going to end up getting you
about 145 PSI that's mathematically doing the numbers so here and that's
pretty close to their
138.236.128.7 the the feature that you have the ability of changing in the table here is letting the techum know
what the new maximum is if you've changed the spring and the valve configuration around so what did we end
up with well first let me mention that the modified run was a little lighter than the Baseline you know most time I
was fluctuating around say 43 to 45% this one was lower and you can
actually see a little bit on how high line pressure climbed but so these numbers might not perfectly match up but
they still kind of foul along the same Trend you could see I went from basically floated around 56 and went up
to 70 54 to 66 so that was understandable I don't think I really lost pressure with the modification I
think I was just operating with a little bit less engine torque so then it doesn't need as much pressure to hold it
together it took two seconds to go up to about 50 and as I mentioned earlier with the Baseline took 2.14 to go up to 52 so
you can see nothing really changed because I didn't change the max pressure in the converter even though I told the
uh HP tuners that there is an increase in maximum pressure now in reality you would never see Max pressure under light
throttle conditions under wide openen throttle we get a little closer to Max
Pressure but so here you can see my maximum pressure that I did achieve was 84 and 80 on the Baseline but on the
modified I got the 84 so I really didn't get have an increase there either it's
took me from 600 milliseconds to get to 60 PSI it took me 600 milliseconds to get
to 59 60 PSI so I really didn't change anything there's no substantial there's
no significant change the pattern looks like this pattern right here looks almost identical to that one shape and
sizewise you can see the ramp looks almost identical the ultimate pressures ended up being pretty much the same took
a little longer on this one to get to 60 PSI just a couple T of a second but
either way no substantial change really once again unless unless you've gone through
and you've done something that gives you the ability to truly increase the the um
regulated maximum that you really you can't force it electronically to go
above what the AFL valve and what the torque conter clutch regulator valve will provide now this is where things
Mod 4 - TCC Regulator Gain
get a little confusing torque converter clutch regulator gain what is it HP tuners defines it really clearly as the
gain of the torque converter clutch regulator valve whatever that means and that number did change quite a bit I
mean the one the this 2014 Silverado was 375 and you saw some of the earlier
units they were listed at 1.5 now sometimes you see the term gain
used in hydraulic valves and Transmissions where they're talking about a valve that has a different size
on each side of a valve so when you have pressure in there like in between the two lands you might have a
increased you well should say that the the pressure is going to force the valve to move to one side or the other
depending on which one has a larger valve so those are called gain valves or like a a regulator gains and maybe I was
thinking hey maybe this is the ratio between the one land and the other but I mathematically wasn't able
to prove that out uh so I don't I still don't really know what it is so here are the results and
kind of like the previous one this modified run was a little lower on the throttle so a little bit lower engine
torque than the Baseline and but really the pressures didn't change much you see it took two
seconds little over two seconds to get the 54 and you know on the Baseline I had 2.14 to get the
52 the pressures here are a little bit lower but once again this is the actual
versus desired slip so it's not going to give you any more pressure than you need to maintain slip and it might have lower
pressure here because as I just mentioned I was operating a little bit lighter throttle if that's a little
heavier throttle it's going to have a little more engine torque and it's going to require a little bit more pressure to hold it together so no substantial
change with the light throttle acceleration the wide open throttle acceleration actually ended up with the
lower pressure again now once again this is the trying to match the slip speed so I don't think that this was a factor of
the modification it took 620 milliseconds to go to 60 PSI and that's
about the same as this one a little bit slower than that one so depending on which Baseline you're looking at once
again not that much different so to summarize that regulator gain really didn't change that much as far as the
pressures are concerned they both climbed uh initially to about the same pressure and they did so in about the
same amount of time the one thing thing that could be said is on the Baseline you can see this initial hump right here
is rather low uh you know I've got it identified it goes up 29 as low as 21
and then it jumps up to 52 if we compare it to the modified file you can see that
hump is higher I don't have it pointed out or identified but it's much higher it's probably in the 30s as far as
pressure is concerned so if these two runs were pretty much identical we could
see the change maybe as a result of this modification occurring initially right
there at the very first beginning of this torque converter clutch application if you remember the very beginning of
this torque converter clutch application they're actually trying to maintain a little higher slip usually it was around 100 RPM so they're not bring this is
usually in first gear right here matter of fact that dip right there is the one two shift so you drop it down probably
for drivability sake let it slip a little bit more during the shift to prevent harshness and you could see so
it climbs up drops off and climbs up again when we look at the actual modified file there's less of a dip and
it actually kind of looks like it might be occurring just a little too soon in a sense the one two shift theoretically
should be about right here and that might be just before it but and you don't see that on the wide open throttle
runs on the wide open throttle runs it goes basically from low pressure to high pressure in one single swoop but then
again there firm shifts are what you want during wide open throttle so that may be what this gain is doing when we
add to it more testing would likely be be required to see if that repeats I did look at some other files to see if that
hump kind of repeated itself and in most cases there was a hump and it was lower
I don't know what to call it's called a hump but that initial drop off or transition there was lower on a lot of
shifts so that is possibly something that changed during the uh modification
for the regulator gain so that kind of carries over into the next one which is regulator offset and what is regulator
Mod 5 - TCC Reg Offset
offset still don't really know still unsure on that if you look at the way HP tuners defines it it's the offset of the
torque converter clutch pressure regulator valve it's very um vague and does not
have much of a description there so I'm not really certain exactly what this is now I do have an opinion and if you
remember back to when we covered the Hydraulics the amount of pressure that it took at the regulated apply valve to
get that valve to just start to move over to the point where it actually generates some torque converter clutch
regulated apply pressure it took about 24 PSI and that was all through calculation so maybe this 27 PSI is
identifying how much pressure is required to get to that starting point
so you need this much solenoid pressure to actually move that valve over to the point where it'll actually start
creating torque averter clutch pressure so that's my theory I don't have any way of verifying that but it does seem to
kind of point out that we do need about 24 25 psi to get that valve to move over
so maybe that's what it's referring to I moved it up to 50 psi so that way we can see what actually ends up happening and
of course the pressures pretty much remain the same now if you look kind of like on that regulator gain that first
hump right here after the modification it's much higher and when we compare that to the Baseline as we looked at
before the Baseline it one as high as 29 then drop down to 21 then up to 52 if we
look at the actual modified file it's somewhere up in the probably the mid-30s
so is possible and that there's no distinct drop in pressure as well so
there's a good possibility that just like the regulator gain the regulator offset raises this portion of it and as
I mentioned earlier also that's supposed to occur during the one two shift to kind of soften it and uh it would
definitely soften it when it's dropping pressure like you see here on the Baseline over here it might kind of help
a little bit but it's more almost looking like it did at wide open throttle when pressure just goes from
low to high and starts regulating there but as far as all the other pressures are concerned there's really no
significant change matter of fact the pressure was a little lower uh ended up a little lower than it did on the
Baseline but that was likely due to the fact that I probably wasn't on the throttle engine wasn't generating as
much torque as I was during the Baseline so that really kind of almost proves the
point too when you look at it if I'm not if I was a little bit less on the throttle but yet my initial hump there
during the one two shift was higher whereas if I was a little bit more on the throttle here and my initial hump
was lower you know I don't know it's a theory it's a possibility I think more
testing would be needed to find out if that's the only thing that changes but when you when you stop and think about
it since this is really motivated or driven by slip speed and it's only going
to generate enough pressure to get to the desired slip speed any of these modifications that we create is only
going to do so much once that torque of your clutch is appli wi it's just going to manipulate the pressure to get that
slip speed about the only thing that we can change in here is that apply ramp now on the wide open throttle you'll see
that there's really no difference even looking at the shape of this modified pattern it does a pretty good job of
matching the original Baseline we're a little less than half of a second to 59 PSI we're a little over half of a second
to 60 PSI so it's actually TimeWise it's more comparable to the alternate
Baseline and when you look goes up to 79 versus 80 or 84 so really there is no
difference now I will mention that the first shift and you'll see this if you download the packet the very first shift
after the modification it got the highest pressure that we've measured so far was like in the 90s like 94 or
something like that so um but the last one after we did it a few times and let it adapt a little bit and I know this
says it doesn't adapt but who knows um it didn't shoot up near as high it went
up to as you can see only 79 PSI so to summarize the pressures on wide open
throttle it did they did actually go up quite a bit on the very first shift after the modification afterwards they
kind of leveled out and they were pretty much the exact same if you remember the previous slide there the wide open
throttle was not that much different from the Baseline but the only thing that you can
probably point out is that that initial hump that we see pretty much at the one two shift point is higher on the
modified file than it is on the original file so or the Baseline so I'm going to
pretty much stick to my opinion on what the offset is actually referring to and that opinion is that it's the amount of
pressure required to move that torque clutch regulated apply valve over enough to the point where it's actually
starting to generate some torque rter clutch regulated apply pressure so it's the amount of solenoid pressure required
to move the valve over if you know anything different please feel free to comment I'm all yours so to summarize
Overall TCC Mods Summary
this whole torque converter clutch modification now I want to preface by saying that a lot of people that are
tuning these things they tune all the slip out especially if they're putting an aftermarket converter in there and they've got maybe a paper type friction
uh on the on the converter clutch and at the end of this presentation I go over the inside of this tor converter so you
can see what I'm talking about as far as paper and woven carbon and all that kind of stuff but um if you're going through
modifying this transmission and you've got high performance High horsepower or you're concerned about torque converter
clutch a wear issues go ahead and tune this thing where there's no slip at all but if you're trying to maintain that OE
feel where it's smooth and you don't feel that torque clutch apply you're probably going to want to keep that slip
in there you might turn it off so it's not slipping in all the gears like this one here you could see the torque clutch
applied in first all the way through sixth or you might you know some people just turn it off first second and third
gear and only let the torque of clutch apply in fourth fifth and six some only let it apply in fifth and six but if you
decide to keep it pretty much in a standard format and you're just trying to manipulate and modify based off of
any kind of changes that you've done to the engine or the transmission we'll just realize that
some of these settings here may or may not actually result in any kind of a change since the vehicle I was using was
stock didn't really see hardly any changes except maybe at the very initial portion of that application of the
torque converter clutch and as I mentioned a million times the computer is going to make the actual slip speed
match to the desired and it's going to pulse with modulate that torque converter clutch solenoid to deliver
whatever pressure it needs to make that happen and I want to point out that these transmissions by Nature they apply
this torque clutch very early and they keep it applied the whole time they don't hardly ever disconnect it until
you're below a certain speed and almost at a stop and as I mentioned throughout this presentation the slip speed is
probably some hidden tables in there that we don't have access to because initially like when you're in first and possibly second gear they allow a little
bit more slip and then they even go to less slip when you're in higher gears and uh wide open throttle a lot of times
they'll bring the slip not necessarily to zero even if stated that in the table but they're going to try to bring that
slip a little bit lower so we don't have access it seems to every table but of
the tables that we do have access to you have the ability of controlling some slip and another thing which is pretty
amazing is that the torque converter clutch pressure listed on the scanner especially when you get up into the 50s
60s and 70s 80s you know that pressure range it's actually really accurate to what the
actual torque clutch apply pressure is and it's pretty amazing in my opinion
that this thing works as well as it does and it's not even using all the pressure that has uh that that's available to it
as we saw usually if at wide open throttle on average the pressure got into the mid 80s but this thing could
easily achieve 140 PSI if that torque conter clutch solenoid actually want it
to so there there's more room for adjustment and movement yet it gets it
done with a relatively low pressure I know I say that 85 PSI will put over
7,000 pounds of force on that piston but and you're going to see coming up here
how this torque converter actually operates and works and the parts and pieces and some of the upgrades some of
the Billet pistons and the Billet covers and some of the different friction materials so here is a six lady torque
6L80 Torque Converter Teardown!
inverter and I've actually gone through and cut this one in a little pie shape
so you can look at the inside and I cut it along the weld there actually kind of
off to the side so that way we can study what's going on on the inside of this converter this is the converter
cover so this is the surface right here that the friction material comes into contact with that ply piston moves
towards the engine and applies up against this nice smooth surface here
this cover you can see there's the mounting pads that's where the flex plate is bolted to the torque inverter
cover so this is always driven by the engine and then when we apply the converter piston and it pushes up
against this nice smooth surface here it's going to deliver torque through the Piston through dampening Springs right
to the input shaft of the transmission and this is the turbine for the 6l80
it's got splines on the inside there that spline to the input shaft of the transmission if I flip this around you
could see that pie-shaped converter piston is right here and with that converter piston you can see the
friction material they use here is this woven carbon fiber the benefit of this
woven carbon fiber is that when they apply pressure up against this thing even when it's touching the cover fluid
can Wick its way through this friction material and pull he heat away so that's
the benefit of it that's the reason why they can get away with running slip on this converter continuously when we
think of this whole surface area area that we've got and we actually measure across this diameter of the friction
material which is 11 in and we subtract the 2 inches from the middle this thing's got over 90 in of surface area
90 square inches of surface area if you multiply that by 85 PSI which is something that we've seen in this torque
converter that's over 7,800 lb of force
that's pushing up against this converter cover so that's just stock configuration
under normal operation it's not enhancing anything or kind of uh beefing
anything up that's just using stock pressures and a stock configuration on driving the vehicle at wide open
throttle like we would expect so it's generating over 7,000,000 lbs of force
up against this piston pushing it up against the cover and because of that many Builders will opt to put an
aftermarket converter cover in which is Billet so this is is this is a Billet
chunk of Steel that they machine this cover out of you can see the pads they're machined out of this material
they're actually they're not welded like the OE converter is and it's thicker it's a thicker chunk of Steel other then
this piston is also thicker and so there's less deflection
less flex and that is what a lot of people attribute the converter failures
to D in this uh transmission so this is a nice upgrade a Billet cover and a
Billet piston so the two different types of friction material that you'll find that these people rebuild them with is
either this woven fiber or the cellulose or paper design a lot of aftermarket
converter Builders will use this cellulose or this paper design when they're rebuilding these converters a
because they're more comfortable with it and B because it's thicker it's comes in a couple different thicknesses but it's
thicker than the the woven fiber and the reason why that becomes an issue is because sometimes they have to machine
that piston and remove Material off it or if they're reusing a cover they're going to have to machine the cover well
that obviously takes up some metal and and the woven carbon fiber doesn't come
in thicker pieces but the paper friction material not only does it come in different sizes but it's also
automatically thicker and uh it will replace some of the space that's lost by the metal but an issue might arise that
if you're using a paper friction material in a place where there's supposed to be a woven fiber and you
don't remove the slip that this might end up overheating or glazing and then giving you some drivability issues so if
you were to change the friction material from the woven fiber to a paper design
it's probably a good idea to remove that slip in these tables and force this converter just just lock up like they
did in the good old days but if you want the drivability to be the same as it was
in a stock vehicle in configuration you're going to want to use that carbon fiber now it's not a big deal if if you
use that carbon fiber and you upgrade to that Billet cover and that Billet piston
because those won't deflect like the original converter does and they'll be able to handle the more torque the more
uh pressures and so forth so nothing NE nothing wrong with this woven carbon fiber but if you're ordering a converter
from a builder or a you know supplier make sure you know what you're getting if you're going to get a carbon fiber
lining or a paper lining or request one or the other and if you got some real power you can opt to put the big dog in
there and have your Builder build the converter with this this is a Billet cover and a Billet piston but what makes
it special is that it's got a multiple disc clutch assembly in there so you actually have three surface friction
surface areas as opposed to just one so if you look this piston lugs into the
cover it's got a woven carbon fiber friction material on this side and then what lugs into the Piston
is a double-sided friction disc so this one
has um a kind of a more of a high performance heavy duty feel to
it so I wanted to point out the differences in these converters because you have options and there's heavyduty
converters that are using Billet covers and Billet pistons and different types of friction material in it there's stock
converters that are stamp steel Pistons stamp steel covers and they have woven
fiber um friction lining it which is perfectly fine but you need to know
what's going on what what you have in the vehicle when you're tuning this because if you're going to tune it with
slip or tune it without slip it helps to know what kind of friction material you have and how this converter is
built

You said:
hello I'm here at the dyno and this is
the first step of my little experiment
here I'm going to do on the 6l80 6l90
transmission and what I'm going to try
to do is figure out what you're actually
changing when you change these tables in
HP tuners if you've ever tuned these
tecums and the 6l86l 90s you'll probably
know that there's a lot of these tables
that aren't very intuitive they don't
seem to make sense it leaves you
wondering what you're actually changing
when you modify the numbers if you're a
transmission person like myself and you
have a pretty good understanding of the
Hydraulics that's going on when you see
online some of these people that are
tweaking and changing some of these
values you kind of wonder if they're
actually changing what they think
they're changing so that's the purpose
of what I'm going through to do here is
kind of do modifications change things a
little at a time one step at a time and
actually do run these things on a Dyno
not necessarily this transmission Dyno
but on a chassis Dyno to see how it all
works now the reason why I have it here
on the chat on the transmission Dyno is
because I had to modify this lower Veil
body half I had to drill a bunch of
holes in it I had to weld this section
shut so that I can put a tap in there so
I had to go through and do some
modifications to this lower valve body
so that I can get pressure TAPS in there
I wanted to make sure it didn't screw up
this valve body half to the point where
it wouldn't work on a vehicle so I
figured I have a transmission got plenty
of these cores the students go through
these in my class so I just put one up
on the dyno put my modified valve body
half on there see if it works this
connection right here
feeding into the tecum is just a pigtail
that you can buy off the Internet it's
pretty cheap I think 75 bucks
and a company called EFI connections
makes those you'll see them they also
make other connections for for computers
and so forth I bought this E38 ECM off
of eBay for like 75 bucks or something
came with the pigtails on them and I you
can buy just grabbed one off of a car
that we were scrapping out but you can
buy these DLC pigtails and I basically
just got power ground and some
communication lines
and what I've done is I've connected the
tekum communication lines which are
these tan wires to the
ecms communication lines
and then I've connected those to the
diagnostic link connector I put a 60 Ohm
resistor
across the communication lines because
they're supposed to be terminated so can
high and can low need to be connected
with 60 ohms I didn't have 60 ohms so
this is two 100 ohm resistors wired in
parallel then one 10 Ohm resistor wired
in series with that
and then you basically provide Power and
ground to your tecum your diagnostic
link connector and your ECM
and you're good to go you can
communicate
at that point that's basically a bench
harness and when you plug a scan tool
into it or the HP tuners tool into it
you can go through and communicate
you're going to have a bunch of codes
there's going to be a lot of data that's
missing and so forth but it still
connects and communicates you can still
pull a tune upload a tune
you know and do those kinds of things
some of those different features
so what I've got going up here on these
different computer screens here is I've
got I wish I had an eight channel
picoscope I only have two I have four
Channel picoscopes but I've got on this
computer I've got the one two three four
clutch the three five R clutch the 456
clutch and the two six clutch they're
all tapped in there with pressure taps
and these pressure Taps basically
utilize these
cheap Chinese transducers I mean we
don't have an unlimited budget here and
I'm just playing around so these only
cost like 25 bucks you can just search
them up 500 PSI pressure transducer and
that's what you get really works well
with the scope because
0 psi here at sea level
is um or you know just atmospheric
pressure at sea level is equal to
about a half of a volt and then 500 PSI
is four and a half volts
and if you're a negative 15 psi like if
you're going to use this for measuring
vacuum it goes down to about 375
millivolts so anyway if you just hook
this up to a dvom and try to interpret
the values the numbers aren't going to
directly equate the pressure so you'd
with the scope like a picoscope I can
put a custom range in here and I can let
it do the corrections on the side so
they'll actually read in accurate
pressure readings so that's what we've
got going on there
so like I said this picoscope right here
I've got reading
on this computer the clutches basically
everything but the low reverse clutch
and then this picoscope over here on
this computer is measuring just line
pressure and torque over to clutch
pressure now some of the things that
you're going to notice while running
this thing on the dyno is that there's
going to be a lot of noise on the screen
and these big electric motors and so
forth they put out a lot of
electromagnetic interference
but this thing has these Picos have the
ability of filtering so after they
record their data I can filter it out it
cleans out all that noise that high
frequency noise and you can actually see
the pressure
okay in case you were unaware
in the HP tuners scanner if you click on
the screen button here where it says
vehicle controls and special functions
that opens up
this box that allows you to do a bunch
of different things from controlling a
idle speed to turn your fuel injectors
on and off and but we're going to look
at the transmission with that you can go
through and turn different drivers or
the solenoids on and off you can reset
adapts
you can command different gears you can
turn the torque motor clutch on and off
but first start out with we're looking
at these different gear commands and
when I shift from first to second
you can hear the transmission actually
shift and you can actually hear it
struggle there's something wrong with
this transmission I'm going to shift it
in the third
it eases up sounds a little easier on
the on the ears
and put shaft spins a little faster let
me shift it in the fourth
sounds like it's struggling again
fifth
and then lastly six
and I can go on and turn the torque
motor clutch solenoid on
apply lock up too
downshift me back down in the first
so after we cleaned off all this noise
you can see the pressures are pretty
good on this transmission matter of fact
the issues with this thing binding in
second fourth and sixth gear we can tell
by looking at this is not a hydraulic
problem because when we're in second
fourth and sixth all we have are the two
clutches that are supposed to be applied
those are the ones that have hydraulic
pressure so we know it's not a hydraulic
issue we know it's not coming from a
solenoid or a valve that extra load
that's occurring on the motor on the
electric motor on the dyno that's likely
occurring because there's a mechanical
problem there likely the students didn't
get that three five r drum all the way
down and they miss the clutch and when
they bolted it together they crushed it
and that's dragging that on so that's
what I'm assuming won't be able to find
that out until I take that transmission
apart but really what I was trying to
prove out here is that the valve body
modification that I did Drilling and tap
into that plate that all that stuff
worked out well and wasn't hanging a
valve or having any crazy cross leaks or
just leakage period you can see here on
this pressure graph in green I've got
the one two three four clutch and as
soon as I shift in the second the two
six clutch pressure climbed up
and when I shifted into third my two six
dropped off and my three five R climbed
up and when I shifted into fifth gear
fourth gear the three five R clutch
turned off and the 456 clutch turned on
and then you can see when I shifted into
fifth gear the one two three four clutch
drops off and my three five R comes back
on
and you want to shift in the six my
three five R drops off and my two six
comes out so at any one of these I can
kind of look at
how the pressures are interacting so
even like in this one here if I pushed
off
anything that's not related to the shift
this is the offcoming clutch and this is
the oncoming clutch and these pressures
right here are where they're kind of
controlling the quality of the shift how
quick that clutch applies to bridge the
gap of the speed between the input and
the output shaft so that about does it
on this transmission Dyno now I'm going
to take this valve body I'm going to put
it on a vehicle we've got a 2014 Chevy
Silverado that's bone stock it's in
great shape very low miles on it and
it's in perfect condition so be a
perfect candidate for this because when
I go to do any modifications I know I'm
dealing with a good engine and I know
I'm dealing with a good transmission and
like I said everything's bone stock and
I don't plan on modifying the engine on
this is just all different transmission
tunes and modifications that we're gonna
toy with on that and this process is
probably going to take a couple months
to complete I don't want to rush through
this thing I don't want to
finish some tests button it all back up
and then kind of wish I did some more
tests and I have to kind of redo a bunch
of things so I'm the only one that uses
this vehicle it's a school vehicle
there's no demand for it so I my plan is
is to kind of take my time and go
through this thing so you might not see
updates on this information very
frequently and maybe once every couple
weeks or something like that but I
promise you as as I gather content I
will provide it to you guys and at some
point maybe we can do a live stream
maybe towards the end once I've gotten a
lot of information I feel pretty
confident on what I'm looking at and we
can go through do a live stream and you
guys can request different things we
could do some modifications and I can
upload them and run them right there on
the dyno live so anyway if you have any
questions or comments or any requests
you can feel free to comment post them
up below and I'll try to keep you in
tune with what's going on see what I did
there
You said:
so 6080 Robert we've got a 6080 here and
you guys have discovered something with
these Center supports and a way to kind
of improve upon the OE design
well what we've seen in these is that
the center support will actually start
moving in the case
uh yeah I can see that moves about
eighth of an inch yeah so when they get
pretty bad
they'll get the new seal
and it'll chew it right up
so now you have leaks a little flapper
looks like it could uh
it's like halfway circumcised or
something that's just the tip
okay so that that blows that out and
these are
low reverse and two six clutches so
obviously that would be a bad deal yeah
you got your Lube circuit in there also
you need to this is this is important
what we've noticed is that inherent to
the vehicle 6l86 L90 this case here is a
6l90 and the way you can tell real quick
is the 6L 90 has a ridge around the
brute seal
reinforced yeah it seems to be because
when you look at the 6l80 case
it didn't you know it doesn't have that
yeah so it's
it's kind of a thinner less reinforced
casting they raise that up around there
yeah there's a seal against anything or
is it just does the valve body sits on
it they just raise the boss it's kind of
like you know to control maybe some
movement yeah I'm just guessing I don't
know sure but it's different for sure
okay
so what do you guys do to
cure this does it cure the wobble or
just cure the seal no it actually does
best for both worlds okay
um what we came up with is what we call
a center support stabilizer
and in our kit
they're two short ones and two long ones
because if you look at the the
dimensions here the two outboard ones
are longer right or deeper so you need
the longer insert can you even see that
on the seal yes and then you've got the
short ones that go in the center okay
okay the idea behind this is
we're we're going to prepare this we're
going to drill it out and then remit
okay and that alone is going to put four
tubes in there that's going to hold the
center support but that's not where all
the all the magic is done okay you know
it kind of eliminates the rotating but
what we're after here also is we're
pushing the center support down so the
idea is when it pushes down
the lug right here is going to be
pressed up against this okay so now
these lugs are helping you know make
support plus it makes the case more
rigid okay
I'm surprised those things don't beat
themselves up because every time you
downshift into first every time you get
a shift in the second
you're going to get a and sixth
you're gonna get in Reverse if you
engage in Reverse you're going to get
that clearance is gonna be taken up
every time right so now these things are
going to hold it so you don't get that
clunk it's almost like an anti-clunk
system yeah it it it it eliminates noise
I've had some people report that they
they learn quicker okay you know and
customers I've actually been called by
customers that say that their trucks
never driven so well you know because it
eliminates uh three two clunk a two one
clunk uh Park to reverse you know it
just helps there there are a lot of
fixes out there for this but this one
here it just it just uh
it just takes care of all those issues
so how do we how do we do it we uh gotta
drill it first to put a fixture on here
right no uh actually it's simple
so we made this little jig here okay and
it's got a small diameter pin and then
it's got the large diameter pin okay so
what you're going to do with me yeah you
look at that Robert what would you say
study as a rock steady as a rock but
this is the hand I drilled oh my gosh
I have to do part two on that one day
all right Blazing Saddles there you go
so what you're gonna do you're gonna
push that into one of the orifices there
okay
now you're gonna put
a drill guide
these the same you just got two of them
no they're that that's the small
diameter for the drill 9.8 millimeters
okay
so you're gonna push that in now if this
were a virgin case you'd probably have
to knock it down with the hammer so to
get it to lay flat up against the center
support okay so you need to hammer down
on the Virgin right there you go
so in your instructions we talk about
the distance that you have to let the
drill go on I just put tape there all
right now looking at the center support
the one orifice
runs into a wall right here okay okay so
when you drill down you'll feel where
where it hits that okay and the other
three you can drill
quite a distance okay so that's why we
want you to limit how far you go you
don't want to drill all the way through
you're basically just drilling it enough
for the new pieces to fit in correct
okay so you're going to drill these
three holes and then you're going to
ream them then ream them okay and after
you do that you're going to take this
jig turn it around to the fat side here
and put the fat side into one of the
reamed ones okay and then you do prep
that hole there you go okay okay so do
that with uh what size drill bit is this
that's 9.8 millimeter not whoa so you
guys provide the drill bit yes it comes
in the kit the kit when you first buy it
comes with enough to do five
Transmissions oh okay comes with the the
jigging remover you know the the guide
remover comes with your reamer your
drill bit your jig uh 3 8 16 bolts so
that when you need to pull them out you
can or install them slide in room out
right you can slide hammer it out and
then when you put it
you want to put that into there and
knock it so that way you're not digging
up the O-ring surfaces that's correct
all right so should I go and start
drilling yes sir all right
foreign
[Music]
I think I probably need a little more
that's basically just about a quarter of
the suction is still there
I got a aluminum burn now on my drill
bit
I think I'm good there you go
so let's go ahead and do all three oh
yeah all three
right there
we want to use our tool that comes with
it it's got a slide helps extract that
you do that one hell of a slide here we
got there
it's a equalizer okay
knock it down
what does that
going and Robert likes his ears
oh hood lights
[Music]
okay now you want to ream it
so do you um put any oil on it when you
ream it just ream it dry no I just do it
dry
okay can you do it with the drill yes
[Music]
and these are special reamers you can't
get these like McMaster or somewhere you
yeah it's a standard 10 millimeter ring
Okay so
that's it
we'll slide hammer that up for me sir
it's a nice little setup
everything's kind of a
fits right
everything come out okay now you want to
pull that out
put it in swap it out
and then just go straight to ring no you
gotta drill
it's not like shampoo and conditioner in
one no I should work on that we should
make a variable rate drill bit is what
you're saying exactly
that drill bit's been used quite a bit
it needs to be replaced
still Cuts yeah
foreign
now your Center support
is prepped the tool kit is basically at
cost okay you know
so we want people to do it but we're
going to finish on it
it's well it's pretty
pretty ugly not just
so now you can put that back in
like a glove
it's still loose Robert all right so
you want to get one of your supports
put an o-ring on the bottom now if this
were a live build you'd want to
lubricate it you know
and then you just put it in there so you
kind of kind of tap them in because
that's a Precision Fit yes now you you
have to until it bottoms out
you'll know
I'm gonna get her cooker do you so these
are the shorter of the that's the
shorter one
but if you screw up you can slide Amber
back right
I'm going to stop and interrupt half
this thing
you hear it I heard it bombed out okay
now try to move that Center support
that's just one
yeah that's tight
there's another one short
long
so really what you're drilling is just
this little part right so if you don't
like it just buy a new center support
or if you screw up horribly right we're
distracting and drilled all the way
through to the other side so now what
you're going to do you're gonna put your
assembly Lube on there
put that into place
then I got a valve body I did this so we
could test the the seal the Integrity of
the seal okay so go ahead you can put
that on there to drop it straight on
because we didn't use transgel on those
there
it's kind of laying in there
now when you tighten it up I want you to
feel you're you're a builder and you'll
notice something when you tighten it up
it cracks in half yeah basically
yeah
pressing those O-rings I guess
nice okay
yeah gives kind of a compression fit
there okay now tap the case
solid that's right
now you have all those lugs
holding it hmm
this is a good fix it comes in the
Toledo Max in our ttk Max kit the
stabilizer tubes and its seals come in
it
good okay very nice
we've also got your snap Rings that's
nice especially for me
oh we Rings final damage the snap brings
they go shooting across the shop and
never to be fine again
ah the O-rings that you don't want to
forget when you put those in
now that's real important that yeah see
the seal in there green seal in there
yes sir so for those guys that want to
weld the drum because it's a must and if
it's got any kind of mileage on it if
you use the tools to check the the drum
with you'll see where they leak yeah and
that's a real importance there goes off
that compensator yeah
so the ttk max kit well I just not to
interrupt you but it looks like just in
case you don't want to deal with the uh
Drilling
did I see the bridge seal is it no no
the bridge seal is not included so you
have to either buy that separate if you
don't plan on it or or buy the regular
kit yeah by the regular kit or just plan
on doing this upgrade correct
that's good
I like it well
did you come up with this yeah so we did
we I was wondering is this something
that you uh I know it's always a team
effort but it's a team effort it was my
idea okay good
all right so I'm going to stop saying
bad things about it
you're going to say them anyway yeah
that's true all right thanks John yeah
no problem thank you

You said:
hello my name is sean boyle and i teach here at southern illinois university and this video is about the 6l80 6090 heavy
duty performance kit offered by transgo it is entitled the tow and pro kit
and some of you guys that rebuild transmissions you're really going to appreciate this kit because it includes some of their individual kits plus it
includes a few extra goodies to basically beef up this transmission and make it work for a heavy-duty situation
like towing or racing now i want to go through and say a special thanks to our recent graduate arleigh coleman he was a
student of mine in the transmissions class and he took on an extra project and he did all the muscle work in this
video pulling a transmission out tearing it down cleaning everything up putting it all
back together putting it back in the vehicle and running it on the dyno and i want to say special thanks to him
without all the extra work that he did we wouldn't have been able to make this video also thank you transgo for sending
me this kit so that way we can go through and evaluate it now we have a cts-v here donated to the program
fortunately we cannot drive it on the road but we do have an all-wheel drive dyno so we've been running this thing on
the dyno we ran this vehicle before we took it apart and kind of collected some information then we took the
transmission out took it apart installed the programming kit reprogramming kit and then put it back
on the dyno and we've got our little first impressions there of this kit and i'll tell you right now the kit is muy
bueno very good so this is a kit from transgo and you can go to transgo.com and learn more about their products
specifically we're covering the 6l80 tow and pro and you can see here transgo has been around making
transmissions better for 60 years and this is 2022 that this video was made so that's pretty impressive 60 years of
making transmissions better good job transgo we're going to go through and we're going to look at this kit this kit
is a combination of a couple of their individual 6l80 kits plus some additional stuff that they use for the
heavy duty kind of application in the racing application and it also has
information on tuning if you use efi live or hp tuners it gives you some suggested changes that
you can do in the tuning software that'll complement this kit now talking with transgo they said you do not need
to doing it you could just install this kit it'll work fine it'll work great even without a tune but if you want to
make it perfect consider using that software and tuning it and they have some videos on
specifically what to change and i'll show you those later in this video now this product is called their
toe in pro you can see here drive tow race so you got a little bit of everything so if you've got a heavy duty
application like a truck or you got a corvette or a camaro or something like that that you've got this transmission
you're planning on racing you might consider installing this kit i'll tell you right off the bat that the transmission does have to be removed
from the vehicle it's just not a valve body kit you have to pull the transmission out so you can pull the bell housing off and get the pump apart
because there's essential parts that you need to change in the pump and you can't get to those parts unless you pull the
transmission so if you don't plan on pulling a transmission do not install this kit because the parts in the valve body work
in conjunction with the parts in the in the pump and if they were mismatched you're gonna have problems so
plan on doing the whole thing and while you're in there you might as well go through and freshen it up and their instructions which by the way
transgo has kind of revised their site in the last couple years where they've added their instructions to their kits
right here under documents you click on it you can pull down their instructions and you can see kind of what you're up against on their website they show a
nice graph of what the their kit actually does the pressures in this transmission and you can see over here they show that that transco pressure is
a little bit higher and that gets you that firmer shift like you like and then the shift pressure here which is really
what kind of controls the smoothness of the shifts you could see that the trans
go through their boost valves that you're going to see later on in this video how they manipulate the pressures
in there to make for a nice smooth shift and as i mentioned before their instructions are available on their
website and they're really good they're good learning tools right there you can go and download these instructions even
if you're not planning on rebuilding a transmission you can learn a lot just from reading the instructions not only do they have the repairs and the fixes
and all that but they explain some stuff here and there and they kind of describe common problems and what to look out for
now the towing pro it's a pretty big instruction sheet it's like 12 pages long but
not all of it is going to be their fixes there's going to be a lot of information things that you might want to know when
you're going through rebuilding it so don't be intimidated by the thickness or the amount of pages on their
instructions there's just a lot of information in there that's helpful when you're rebuilding or diagnosing a transmission
on their first page they explain it right here you got the produce a one two and two three hard
throttle tire chirping shifts that'll bring a smile to your face but this first page pretty much deals
with the oil pump and this next page right here is going to go through and describe the stator if you have an early
style stator rings stator they have these rings and expanders that allow you to deal with that all the transmissions
i've ever dealt with has the late model that have those tabs but they've got that information and effect so if you happen to be going through a real early
6l80 you can deal with that now this page right here is going to be covering the
upper valve body half and all the different springs and pieces and parts things that you're going to reuse the
things that you're going to replace all laid out there in their order in their fashion real nice this lower valve
body right here they're going to be doing the same thing describing what you need to change and what goes where they also point out the
different designs depending on what design you have might dictate what springs you use we'll
cover that in the video when we take it apart on the bench even the pressure switch repair these pressure switches if you're familiar
with this transmission they have a tendency of cracking when they crack they create all kinds of codes and
problems so there's a broken one right there well they include enough filaments and rubber o-rings to repair these
pressure switches they even give you some hints and some tips on how to go through and change it because they are
kind of tricky to change and when you get through and you finally go through and change all these you want to test them to make sure they're not leaking
and they explain to you how to go through and test that using an air gun and a washer then comes the optional transmission
tuning and there's the qr code if you scan that it'll take you to their video where they explain some of the things
they want you to change but basically you're going to go through using efi live or hp tuners you're going to change the transmission shift tables so that
way the transmission tune will work in conjunction with this physical hard parts kit and it'll be
like a match made in heaven so the rest of this document is going to include stuff that's going to help you rebuild it like clutch pack clearances and part
numbers for different selective rings or plates how to identify a valve body if it's an early or late by looking at the
stamps and the little um the letter stamps and what's ground down so you can provide information on what type of
valve body or spacer plates you have so that way you can properly identify it even if you have a bmw version of this
they're going to help you identify that and even though it's not included in this kit they explain their cooler bypass setup so that way a few
transmissions these later model you can see 2014 and on 6l86 l90s
they're going to have a bypass valve and they have a tendency of running hot so this is a modification to basically
prevent the bypass from occurring and allow this transmission to stay cooler longer
so as i mentioned before arlee did all the heavy lifting but before he took the transmission out we ran this
transmission on the dyno on the all-wheel drive dyno and we got a sense for how this transmission shifted
and we collected some information then we we actually arley pulled the
transmission out and piece by piece we went through as we took these components out of the oe
transmission we studied them try to figure out how they how they operated what they did with how they functioned
and then before we put the kit components in we studied those and we did some calculations and some math
which may or may not be off a little bit but the philosophies and concepts are going to be the same
and we went through and we tried to figure out what's actually occurring in this transmission when we put that kid
in and when we were done with it arleigh put the transmission back in it put it back on the dyno this transmission shifted beautifully so what transgo did
was excellent i highly recommend it so stick around and watch arlie and i try to figure out how this kit operates
so we're over here at the bench and arley's got this transmission taken apart we've got the oil pump portion the
bell housing the oil pump is split off of the bell housing and we've got some of the trans go kits
the parts that we're going to replace in here he's got these laid out here on the bench for us
so what what are these parts that we're looking at here so this is part of the boost and pressure regular valve
assembly we have a new boost valve assembly which comes with a bigger boost valve
right here the boost valve yep and this is the bushing that it kind of rides in there right correct
there's going to be a spring in there that spring is already inside the pump we are going to reuse the spring so they do have a spring that you have to reuse
how about this spring what is this uh that's a new pressure regular valve spring that comes with the kit
and there's a pressure regulator valve and new seat for the spring
so that all lives on here and is going to live inside this pump assembly
and so we replace the spring we replace the pressure regulator valve
the boost valve and the or the boost valve and the bushing that the boost valve rides in how about this little guy we got a
cotter pin a check ball and a tiny little spring what's all that part of that's going to be a pressure relief
valve assembly inside the pressure the boost valve assembly okay
so this all fits in here correct kind of like check it out first then the spring and then the cotter pins gotta hold
everything together okay and that goes in there so this pressure relief valve i could
see that the oe bushing doesn't have that incorporated into it and transgo obviously put this in there for
a reason do you know what its purpose is what it's doing transco determined that the spike in afl
pressure may cause certain components to cause excessive wear or failure so they want to bleed that pressure off to
prevent that failure okay good so these replacement parts they have in
here sometimes they accommodate for wear that's going to occur like we'll compare the oe to the replacement valve and we're also
going to measure the tension of these springs and measure some of the surface areas especially on this boost valve
because in these kits they could modify that and they could change that that's going to change the overall pressure in this transmission
i can already tell by the look of the and the design of this valve that they have larger lands you could tell those
larger lands they're going to be hopefully riding in areas that haven't seen wear from the factory uh valve
setup so we're going to take this apart do a comparison look at the spring tensions and see how much they changed maybe get
an idea of how much you're changing pressure in this in this unit when you go through and install a kit
what do you think arleigh you want to take this thing apart for me and we'll do a side-by-side comparison of these parts yeah it sounds great all right
so here we have the oe pressure regulator valve and the transom pressure regulator valve and you can see some
differences for one the construction this is an anodide the oe uses an anodized aluminum
and transgo they love their steel they make everything that they can out of steel steel bushings
that the boost valve will ride in and their steel valves and of course steel springs but now if you also look
see all the additional surface area they've got here they've got all this additional surface area right here on this valve and then
they add on the surface material here and this extra material that i got on this transo valve is going to ride on
unused metal in this pump and this as we know from previous videos
and so forth this oil pump suffers from a lot of wear and especially this valve suffers from a lot
of wear so it's really imperative when you overhaul these transmissions that you deal with the oil pump wear and this
transgo deals with it by adding material to the valve so that this new fresh material rides an unused
portion of our previously unused portion of metal that was in the oil pump
now the other things that we could see that's different that that hole right here connects to the end of this valve
and that's going to be there because this is a relief this area in this pump right here is a relief where when oil pressure gets in there it gets exhausted
out there's actually a passageway right through the pump it's not a magic trick i'm able to find a hole
put that right through and that's also the reason why they have a notch cut out is that when this thing moves over far
enough to the point if that original valve land right here ends up blocking
this and prevents oil that's in the decreased passage from finding its way out it can always
sneak out through that so this ensures that also that oil can find its way out to the exhaust if that
situation happens another thing they do different on this unit is that
they've got a hole drilled through the line pressure land
and that goes all the way over to the end of the pressure regulator valve
so just like the traditional gm pressure regulator valves pressure that gets into that hole can find its way to the end
and that's the regulating end so this part right here is what receives line pressure and it creates a force that's
going to compressing the spring this spring here that lives on that end
it's going to compress that spring and that's going to determine minimum line pressure
then the pressure that comes from the boost valve side is going to determine pressure rise
so in summary the modifications that transgo made to these valves is a added
material so that way the valve can ride in previously unused material in the pump bores
and they added these oil passages to allow oil to drain out through the spring end of the valve when needed
and to allow line pressure to find its way over to the reaction land to actually start compressing the spring
let's go and do two things one let's go and take a look at the size difference between
the boost valve that comes in the transgo kit and the boost valve that comes as oe or
stock so the oe boost valve is 450 thousandths of an inch in diameter
pressure is going to work across that and the trans go version
470 so it's got a little larger surface area if we were to do the math
to figure out the surface area we would say that we got 470 thousands that's the transo size divide that by
two so that's the radius 235 thousandths multiply that radius squared 0.235
and then we multiply that by pi 3.14 and we get 173
thousandths of a square inch that's the amount of surface area we got on the transgo valve the
factory valve is 450 thousandths divided by two
multiply it again 0.225 equals a little over 50 thousands multiply that
by pi and we get 159 thousandths of a square
inch so looking at these boost valves since they are different sizes so these have two completely different
surface areas the oe surface area is 159 thousandths
of a square inch and using just as an example let's just pretend that the pressure control
solenoid from this valve body is delivering a hundred pounds the most it could deliver
is like 115 psi and it'll be between zero and 115 if
it's just sitting there idling it's not going to deliver anything because you don't need any additional pressure but if you are under low like wide open
throttle the pressure control cylinder is going to let all the pressure that it can control straight to this
boost valve and the max that is is about 115 but let's just use 100 psi to keep our math super easy using this original
valve if we put 100 psi of boost pressure to this we're going to be increasing the
force that this valve can put on this spring 15.9 pounds of force
so whatever spring tension or force that this um you know
the base pressure regulator spring has we're going to be adding 16 pounds of force to it and that's going to cause
this pump pressure to go up higher because when we increase the amount of force here we push everything over
and that causes the pump to operate at a higher pressure before it can move itself back into its regulating position
so now looking at the transgo valve which is 20 thousands larger that actually equates to being 173
thousandths of a square inch so it's a little bit bigger than the oe one which means that when we have that hundred psi
of pressure in here it's going to be pushing instead of 15.9 pounds of force it's going to be
17.3 so that additional couple pounds of force on that spring is going to translate to a little bit higher line
pressure at 100 psi of pressure control solenoid pressure so long and short of
it to simplify it from what we're seeing here so far that just the addition of this boost valve is
going to cause pressures to climb a little higher under load so 100 psi of boost pressure
from the factory is going to be a little lower pressure than 100 psi of boost pressure with the trans-go setup
and then and then the transmission is going to see that pressure and clutches in theory will apply a little quicker
so if any of this stuff sounds a little confusing you can always refer back to the 6l80 hydraulic video to kind of understand
how this stuff works also even if you understand that you can go back to the beginning lectures the intro
lectures and look at the intro to hydraulics and here that we talk about pascal's law and how springs affect
things here we're just trying to focus on what did transgo do in their kit to make this different and
worthy of installing into your transmission overall along those same lines this is that oil
pump it's a vein type oil pump viewed from this side which is the back side the pump actually will spin in the
counterclockwise direction and when pressure gets high enough the pressure regulator valve will
distribute pressure into the section right here between that seal and that pivot pin and that will
actually control the output of this pump if we look right now that creates a suction brings the fluid around and
compresses it so the inlet is on this side the outlet is on that side
once they get enough pressure in there they actually build the pressure regulator valve puts fluid
pressure on this side and that will pivot the slide and you can see what happens to the
space around that oil pump is it equalizes if that pump is equalizing space
it can't suck in and squeeze out fluid as it can when it's in its maximum output so that would be maximum output
that would be minimum output so that's exactly what these pressure regulator valves are doing
when this valve moves over far enough to allow line pressure to find its way in here
that little passageway is right over this spot and actually brings in that fluid pressure into that
that's how line pressure is controlled pretty simple all right we got two springs you could
tell they're different we're going to go ahead and calculate how much force the difference is
we're going to lay this in here and we're going to put it in its approximate regulating position which is like right
about there and measure approximately how far that spring is going to compress before it
gets to the regulating position so we have about 670 thousandths where
that spring will compress before it gets into its regulating position
now let's do that same thing with the transgo stuff because dimensionally they might have machined the pressure
regulator valve or something different this is about 700 and
about 780 thousandths of an inch so that sounded right from when we did it before is it yep
so the transgo valve is 780 thousands
so we're going to take these two springs and we'll compress the oe valve down to 670
thousandths of an inch and measure the force on our force gauge and then we'll go ahead and take the transco valve move
it down to 780 thousandths on the force gauge and we'll see how much pressure change because they they feel like
they're quite a bit different but you can see they're going to be compressed at different spots anyway so
to determine how much force at its regulating spot we really need to measure it so the transgo valve at
780 thousandths of an inch is measuring at
what is that 406. 406.06 pounds all right now we'll do a comparison to
the oe so the oe valve compressed at 670 thousandths is about
3.76 3.76 so these springs right here determine the minimum pressure it's pretty much
where pressure rise starts because these springs are always going to be there even if i don't have any boost pressure
at all so i know i'm going to always have to overcome the tension of that spring so once we figure out the surface area
of this valve this reaction part of that valve and we divide that into the amount of force that we have in the spring
we'll be able to determine how much pressure is required to move that valve to its regulating position that will basically be the baseline or the
beginning pressure so let's go do that with this one here so looking at these the reaction side of
these valves 315 thousands transgo
and there's the oe valve so 315 thousands so 315 thousands divided by 2 equals
then we multiply 0.1575 and that gives us the radius
multiply that by pi so our surface area is .078
now if we take the trans-go valve which is 4.06 and divide it by
.078 we would get 52 psi
so that's what our bare minimum pressure we should never go below that no matter what now using the oe valve
3.76 is the pounds of force on our oe valve divided by
0.078 thousandths as our surface area of the reaction lane of the valve we get 48.2
psi so the difference is only about 4 psi not a lot not a lot here's something
that's pretty interesting is that in order to get the pressure to these boost valves
they deliver that pressure through a tiny little hole that's drilled there's one right there
and the oe1 and the transgo hole is really small
right there little tiny thing that's transgo one the oe one looks even smaller than that
tiny little hole they have these holes they're small because if they're too big when pressure
changes it over reacts to the valve so i don't think this transmission has a big issue with this problem but that tiny
little hole it could become an issue if there's ever excessive clearance that exists between this boost valve and the
bushing because if you lost fluid or from around this imagine you're competing with that size hole so if
there was a leak around this that was greater than the size of that hole you'd never build any pressure back here if you never built any pressure you'd
never have any boost so that might be something that they take into consideration might be why
transgo has a slightly larger hole there and there's the main area of concern with these pumps is when the
pressure regulator valve itself completely wears out sometimes when they wear out they screw
up so much that they wear out the pump bores but a lot of times it's still good enough to use a valve like this that has that
extended land so i think that we covered pretty much what we needed to cover on this one
um of course if you're rebuilding this transmission you're going to want to pay close attention to things like replacing
bushings and the stator there's actually a seal that's under here that when you press this off you got to do it real
carefully support it real well take the bolts out press it off and replace that gasket the bushings
the kit comes with these stator ceiling rings i've never had to use one of those
yet because i haven't gone through an old enough unit if they have these locking rings
these little tabs on there you don't need to use the ceiling rings that come in their kit
but a lot of these transmissions end up tearing up the oil pump and the bell housing because when the converter fails
all that crap finds its way in here and tears up the pump so if that happens you need to get this machine either replace
these parts or get the pump surface machined and get the bell housing machined
okay arleigh i'm going to let you go and put this all back together because uh you took it apart you could put it back together that sounds good
now i've heard of a lot of shops when they go to put these things together and they slide this pin in there
when they lift it over to put it on the belt housing the pin falls out on them so and then they don't notice it and
then when they start it up in the vehicle that shoots out and then that's a kind of a bummer because you got to pull the transmission out to get
back to that spot so kind of be aware of that when you put it in that your little
boost valve pin doesn't fall out on you
[Music]
mmm so we're back here at the bench where
arley's got the valve body taken apart and he's gone through and stripped out some of the valves that transgo has us
modify either by putting new valves in or by putting replacement springs in and we're going
to look at these individually on this side here we've got a clutch select valve we've got the both clutch select
valves these are the trans-go replacement ones this is probably the easiest one to talk about because all
they've really done is just changed the material now they're made out of steel as opposed to the oe anodized aluminum
and you can see there's basically the same thing that's just added steel now i
guess maybe they do that for the mass so it works properly now they did do something
different with the springs on this so right wasn't there yeah the springs if the valve body separator plate slash
gasket the bonded gasket if there was a certain hole in it then they want you to use a different spring
okay the black springs and this one we use the oe springs yep we don't have that cut in our valve body so we don't
or the separator plate we don't need to change springs out makes sense and then this right here
we've got the replacement torque converter clutch valve and you can see it's a steel valve and when you compare
this to the oe valves you can see that they've added a chunk of steel here to kind of a deal
for any wear that might occur in the bore along that area it does also come with a new spring that's recalibrated
because the spring is designed to fit into the end of that veil so in a second here we'll look at the
math involved since they did change the spring we're kind of curious if they've changed the pressures that the torque of your
clutch operates so we'll put these in its regulating position and we'll measure the tension of each of these springs
figure out what's changed as far as torque converter clutch pressures now we've also got these boost valves
and we have a three five r and a four five six boost valve yep and the only thing they've changed on
those is they've changed the tension on these springs and we'll go ahead and take a look at the spring tensions and
see how they've been changed this one right here is the oe both of the boost valves have
the same springs basically but the transgo valves have a little bit different tension and we'll go do the
math and figure out what they've actually changed as far as pressures as far as this boost valve is concerned in
addition to the springs for the 35r and the 456
they've also changed the 260 valve and they've added a kind of a special
spring and a seat in there you can't really see that's behind that plug and when pressure finds its way into the
back of this valve it can unseat that spring and blow off pressure through that tiny hole
and then lastly they re-engineer the afl circuit here so they've got their own
afl valve ambushing that slides into the existing afl slot without any reaming
and they give you a new spring and uh we're gonna take a look to see how that changes the pressures look at
the spring tensions and figure out if they keep the oe afl pressure
do you think they do i don't think so no i think he's cheated and looked ahead may have cheated we
might as well put this thing together as we deal with this valve body but the first thing we'll look at because it's
the simplest are these uh clutch select valves and transgo wants us to be able to drop them in there and they should
bounce like that that sounds pretty good
oh yeah so when as harley mentioned we reuse these springs
and this is a spot where we can put these nice new end plugs in there the big things with these end plugs is
they've got little o-rings in there so that helps seal off any leaks that maybe exist
between the end plugs and the valve body bore so squeeze these suckers in there
and uh probably should do one at a time put our clips in
so the next valve up is this torque converter clutch regulator valve and the
oe valve uses the spring and so does the trans go it has a replacement spring something smaller
that fits in there and as mentioned before you can see they've added some material to deal with bore wear so that's the big takeaway on
this but did they change the spring tensions to really adjust the torque converter clutch pressure and that's what we're
going to look at here and they did they actually went through and tweaked it a little bit the force that they have on the oe valve
is about 4.7 pounds of force working on the end of this oe valve keeping it shuttled over into its relaxed relaxed
position the transgo valve is a little bit lighter of a spring and only has about 3.6 pounds of force
pushing the valve over into its relaxed position so next we'll kind of do a little bit of
math to figure out what kind of torque converter clutch pressure that this thing's being set at the surface areas that we have on the
valves have not changed this area here is still about 452 thousandths of an inch in diameter and
then the surface area that the torque vertical clutch pressure ends up working on when line pressure converts its way into torque verter clutch apply pressure
they work on the ends of these valves which are 370 thousandths of an inch so really we need to concern ourselves
with the torque converter clutch pressure that comes out on this end of the valve and assists this spring in closing off
the feed of line pressure into the torque of your clutch circuit and the oe valve is going to have a
little bit more push at 4.7 pounds than the trans-go valve which is only
going to have 3.6 pounds of force so hydraulically that pressure is going to work across
0.107 square inches of surface material and we're going to go ahead and assume
that the torque inverter clutch solenoid is delivering about 100 psi to the ends of these valves and that 100 psi working
across this reaction end of the valve across across the surface area of a 159 thousandths of a square inch is going to
generate about 15.9 pounds of force that's going to compress these springs a little bit and it's also going to have
to overcome whatever torque converter clutch pressure finds its way onto this end of the valves so we'll do a little
quick pascal's law to figure out how much pressure torque vertical clutch pressure needs to come into these circuits
to regulate itself down to cut off the feet looking at this transgo valve first the
surface area that's on the spring end is 107 thousandths of a square inch
and we're trying to figure out how much the torque converter clutch pressure is i know the amount of force i have to overcome is 15.9
pounds of force now we subtract the actual tension of that spring from that so this transgo spring was 3.6 pounds of
force so the pressure has to actually overcome 12.3 pounds of force so if i divide
107 thousandths into 12.3 i'm going to end up getting 115 psi
so with a hundred pounds of torque converter clutch solenoid pressure i'm going to end up with 115 pounds of
torque over clutch apply pressure so now we're going to look at the oe valve and we still have to overcome our 107
thousandths of a square inch on this reaction land here the side that the spring's on and the total force that we
need to overcome is still 15.9 pounds but this little spring here is helping out with about 4.7 pounds of
force so we have to overcome a total of 11.2 pounds of force so when i divide
107 thousandths of a square inch into 11.2 pounds of force we come up with 105
psi of torque over clutch supply pressure so with the oe valve 100 pounds
of torque of your clutch signal fluid from the torque converter clutch solenoid is going to end up generating
105 pounds of pressure for our torque river clutch supply as far as our calculations are concerned
it looks like the oe valve actually produces a little less pressure than the trans go trans goes getting about 10 psi
more pressure at 100 psi of solenoid pressure to apply that torque converter
clutch i'm going to go ahead and put this valve in and arle you said that this uses the
factory boost valve or the factory m plug yep no o-rings on this one no o-rings okay
so now that we've finished with the bottom half of the valve body we're going to move over to the top half and looking at this valve body here we're
going to change a couple things we're going to change the springs that are located on this boost valves on these two boost valves
we're going to change the 2 6 regulator valve assembly to their kind of fancy
little setup and we're going to change this afl valve and we'll start with the boost valves
because the concept on this thing is pretty simple if you take a look at these springs that we've got these
springs right here they're both identical between the 35r and the 456 boost valves and at
about a half of an inch right where they kind of regulate at they're putting out about 2.4 pounds of force
taking a closer look at this boost valve the difference in surface area between this land and that land is only about
.025 thousandths of a square inch and the pressure that's present in this
area right here is going to move this valve over it's going to compress that boost valve spring that boost valve
spring only has that 2.4 pounds of force and it's going to take on an oe valve
that's going to take about 96 pounds of force to move that over and allow this valve to help regulate
the the boost and that clutch circuit whereas the two transgo valves they give you two different colored springs and
they're different in tension and uh
one's a little higher than the other the orange spring only has about 1.43 pounds of force one incidence regulating spot
whereas the blue one is about 1.88 so both of these springs are much less than the original spring
that had 2.4 pounds of force what that means is to overcome the tension of this orange spring we only
need about 57 psi and to overcome the tension of this blue spring we only need
about 75 psi so these two boost valve springs they're going to require much less pressure than
the oe springs to shuttle these valves over to allow the boost valves to
operate with the clutch regulator valve to allow the clutch field to change basically these
boost valves when they modulate they're going to control how quickly the regulator valve
can shuttle over and they control the ramp rate of the pressure coming into the clutch and then once there's
sufficient pressure and the solenoids pulse with modulated to allow enough solenoid pressure to these valves it
allows the pressure to ramp up to full line pressure but i'm going to go ahead and put these boost valves back in
so we'll start with the 456 jam it in there and the
35r and it uses the blue spring that 456 uses the orange spring
and then we use our little retaining clips there
all fun gains until someone loses an eye okay so now we got our boost valves installed
we're going to move on to this 2-6 regulator valve and they do change this up a bit if i look at this 2 6 valve the oe valve
is just a simple anodized aluminum valve but the replacement valve has
a kind of a cup plug or a screw attached on this side you can see through the opening there there's a spring and then
there's an opening on this side what there is is there's either a valve or a ball through this hollow valve
and pressure on this end we can unseat that valve and relieve the pressure through this passageway here
and when we look at a hydraulic schematic we can see what they're trying to accomplish here this valve the 2-6 valve does not use a
boost valve circuit and what transgo did is they kind of engineered a boost valve into the actual regulator valve itself
so pressure going to the clutch can find its way to the end of this valve and it could unseat that check ball early on
its stroke this is kind of covered into a valve body passage and it can't exhaust off anywhere but eventually when
this valve comes over far enough it actually opens up into an exhaust passage and the pressure that's on this end of
that valve can leak off so it can kind of regulate self-regulate itself eventually when this valve fully strokes
the end of the valve is going to contact the end of the valve body bore and it'll kind of seal itself off so we're not
constantly leaking that pressure off as you can see the hole in that valve is covered by the valve body bore as this
valve begins to stroke as the clutch is applying we could see now some of that pressure that's coming out through that
hole can feed into that oil passage and drain off eventually that valve will
stroke completely and the end of the valve will contact the end of the bore sealing itself off against the end of
the bore so it's kind of a variable leak it seals off in the beginning bleeds off some pressure and then seals off again
okay we're going to go ahead and get this out of the way by putting this valve in there so harley does this use the oe end plug
it does not it uses a new o-ring end plug okay now we're down to our last valve the afl
valve this is the oe afl valve it's got a pre-stout spring on it
and anodized aluminum this is the replacement one and you can see what transgo's done is
they have machined a fresh bushing that slides into the bore so it kind of eliminates
the leakage that might occur from a worn bore which means they have a whole new reaction diameter we have to take that
into account when we do our comparisons it also gives us a new spring you can see the spring is small it's designed to
fit in there and a little spring stabilizer that fits around the outside that all squeezes into the bore it has
its own little end clip there and they probably do that so that the spring doesn't fit through the original clip
so you replace the whole afl lineup with this clip spring valve and bushing
the oe valve has a reaction area of about 98 thousandths of a square inch and that's going to work up against a
spring it's going to compress that spring with about 12.38 pounds of force
in order to get this valve into its regulating position when you do the math here and you divide
12.38 pounds of force and you divide that by 98 thousandths of a square inch you get 126 psi of afl pressure
it's pretty good huh that's very good pretty high pressure so i wonder how the transgo one fares as far as the afl
pressure is concerned let's figure that out so looking at this transgo valve the spring force as far as we've measured it
we're going to overcome is about 5.65 pounds
it's not near as much as the oe valve but the surface area that we've got to work
across is much less it's only about point zero five five thousandths of an
inch thousands of a square inch so now when we divide
55 thousandths in the 566 pounds of force we end up getting about 103
psi so the pressure from this afl valve
circuit and this transo valve is much lower and that's kind of pulling some information together for us because when
we think about afl pressure and if you don't know this stuff you can look at some of these other lectures that are
more on the theory and operation of the 6l86 l90 got all those videos up there but
afl pressure feeds all the solenoids feeds the torque over clutch solenoid it ultimately ends up controlling the
pressure that goes to a lot of these clutches and to the torque motor clutch so when we start looking at some of the
numbers that transgo had for like line pressure for example it seemed like the line pressure would be much higher but
if they're lowering their afl pressure that will kind of bring things back into kind of a a baseline
more of a comparable pressure same thing with even those boost valves that we've got
because our solenoid pressure being delivered to those boost valves might be a little bit lower
because our afl pressure is a little lower and only thing i can guess is that they're doing this to protect some of
the transmission because there's so many areas with the torque converter clutch and also
the 350r drum and the one two three four piston these are all areas that are known to break
so maybe they attribute that to this um afl valve and with the blow-off valve
that they entered into the boost valve circuit in the oil pump that all kind of maybe works together to kind of keep
that under control so we don't get crazy pressure spikes in this transmission i think i think makes sense it makes
things probably a little bit smoother as well yeah so a little smoother operation i do know with talking to transgo they
spend a lot of time engineering these springs so that there is a smooth transition
from low to high especially with things like the torque vertical clutch solenoid because there is a sweet spot that the
solenoids like to operate in and they designed the springs to operate well within that sweet spot that was
something that they explained to me on the phone and before we finish this off we've got
a few more end plugs that we can put in and they end up going into the one two three four
regulator the 35r clutch regulator and the 456 clutch regulator bore
and after those get put in we're going to go through and assemble these two halves
and we'll call it done [Music]
now that arleigh is getting the transmission back together and getting ready to install back in the vehicle the
next step is to run it on the dyno we're going to run it with just the kit installed and then we're going to go
through and add the recommended tune that trans go kind of recommends on their videos and we're going to run it
on the dyno again and see how things changed now this is the original table found under shift timing when you're in
hp tuners you'll see these dialog boxes come up and when you click on any one of these torque adder
buttons that basically explain all the different shifts either under normal or special you're
going to get a table like this that pops up this is the oe table this is unmodified
and like i said before transgo gives you the instructions on how they want you to change it basically they're changing
these top six rows to 500 milliseconds and then the bottom rows below that to 200 milliseconds
and the way you read this description down there it's kind of misleading it says shift time input torque adder one
two then it says it adds to the desired shift time based on input torque and engine rpm now
as far as we can tell it seems like the desired shift time must be zero because when we're done with this it seems like
the values that you get here is pretty much the shift time that shows up when you actually drive this vehicle on the
dyno just to give you another example this is off of a 2016 silverado pulled the shift table information off of it
and you can see the values are different so uh it's going to be different for different vehicles the
stock values but transgo just kind of recommends the 500 200 and when we go through and modify it you can see
everything those top six rows ended up going to 500 milliseconds and then those
lower three rows go to 200 milliseconds and basically what you're looking at is the calculated torque based off of the
engine rpm which cell or value are you going to fall within so at your higher rpm your kind
of your race mode they're going to be looking for a 200 millisecond or a fifth of a second shift time and then when
you're at lower speeds uh kind of cruising around you're gonna have kind of more
you know half of a second shift which is kind of a more common shift time that you would see i usually
you know typically you see between 400 and 500 milliseconds so this would be giving you more of a comfortable shift
or a smooth shift when you're just doing normal driving but could you give you that nice tire tripping with the smile
shift that you would get a wide open throttle or high engine loads another neat thing you can do with hp
tuners is you can log information or record it over time and this right here
is an example of some logged information that we've got now all the stuff right here that you see on the side those are all things
that we kind of selected they're all transmission related you could see things from their command pressures to
the shift times and torque converter clutch operation torque management all that so that's all information you can
get from their tool using the logging or the scanner mode now
you can take anything that's displayed on this and you can make a graph out of it so that's kind of what we did here we
went through and going kind of on this top graph here we've got in red we've got engine rpm
in green we've got speed so that green light you can see i was accelerating there um white is the throttle position so you
can see i was pretty much a wide open throttle that whole time and then that orangish color right there
is uh the current gear and you're going to see on these logs that the only thing
i'm comparing is the 2 3 shift and the 3 4 shift it's was kind of hard to from a standstill
launch off the line at zero miles an hour because the dyno doesn't quite like that a little tire slippage that kind of
stuff and also the four five and the five six shift as you're going to see under wide
open throttle at least we were over 100 miles an hour i don't think hourly was too excited about or actually probably
wanted to do it but we weren't too excited being a school environment want to be safe didn't necessarily want to
spin this thing up a lot faster than 100 miles an hour 110 or whatever it was reaching because that
three-four shift is at pretty high speed when you're at wide open throttle on the second graph basically all these are the
solenoids and their commanded pressures it's kind of neat to see the computer's control of what it's doing to the
pressure on these clutches as you see there's an oncoming clutch and then an off-going clutch
since this is the 2-3 shift this would be the 2-6 clutch coming off and this
would be the 3-5-r clutch coming back on so we can kind of see the shape and when we tune the transmission the shape of
these are going to change a little bit we can't directly measure the clutch pressures all we have is a line pressure
port on this transmission which we really i mean it was so close to the bell housing we couldn't get anything to
fit in there so we didn't actually directly measure line pressure on this and then this bottom graph right here in
red it shows shift time the or the time of the last shift i wanted to put that in there because it was a little cleaner
than having all the clutch shift times up there and in green is torque signal so you could
see the torque signal as we've talked about before that is basically related to the line pressure the torque signal
is the modified afl pressure coming from a pressure control solenoid to control the pump and it's going to be anywhere
between zero and you know maybe 115 or so at max
maybe 100 psi at max and then in white we have the torque converter clutch slip
and the last one is the operation the converter clutch pressure control solenoid so we could see as the solenoid
is doing its job what's it doing to the slip speed is it controlling the torque converter as intended so
i'm going to go through a few of these we're going to look at stock and then transmission kit without the tune and
then transmission kit with the tune to kind of give us a comparison so we can see what's actually changing and all of
these just for the sake of time are going to be a wide open throttle we did record some kind of a
light throttle medium throttle and heavy throttle logs but just to make things simple we're just going to look at wide
open throttle so looking at this first log we've got the stock transmission the 2 3 shift and what we're going to be
looking at here is every for every one of these things i move this vertical line this vertical line is basically taking the values of all these different
pids either here the ones i have graphed or all these that are on that list it basically says this is what those values
were at that given time and through what i did my my thought on this
was is kind of drag this over until i got my value for the time of last shift because that's what we can use to
compare that's really going to give us the indication of has this kit kind of
adjust the firmness and and softness and so forth and you can see here we got a good engine drop engine speed drop this
is stock uh on the 2 3 shift you can see this is the shape of our 35r clutch
coming on so that's what it's doing the control pressure and then this is my torque signal pressure this is going to be the
one that might change around a little bit from slide to slide and i don't know if we can really
put too much faith in those values you can see it's right where i collect that data that downward slope kind of happens and
depending on where this time piece kind of crosses that
if it's up here it's going to be a little higher if it's down there it's a little lower so just kind of take that into account when
you're if you're comparing torque signal pressures from slide to slide to slide you also probably need to see where it lays on this curve
so anyway we'll go through this one was the 2-3 shift and it was about 200 or
375 milliseconds so the big things that i'll look at or point out when we go through these is take a look at the
shape of the engine speed dropping take a look at the solenoid as it's energizing and
controlling that oncoming clutch i guess even that off-going clutch and we kind of take a look to see how that's changed
and then take a look at our torque signal pressure and see how it's modified and we'll all compare that to whatever it's doing as far as the shift
time is concerned so here we switch to the log on the transgo kit installed but
without a tune and if you look we got a nice good engine speed drop right there if we look at the shape of the pattern
it really looks about the same the only thing we're missing is that little blip at the beginning a little blip at the beginning it's probably there is like a
kind of a pre-charge or a bleed function and um it might not happen on every shift
matter of fact usually on units that use that they only do it once so i was kind of surprised to see it on the previous
one this is the previous one so that little blip is what i'm talking about but if you look at the actual pattern
this is going to be the pattern where they're physically applying that clutch you're going to see it goes up kind of flat lines has a little dip right there
and then it kind of climbs back up again looking at our transgo kit installed it goes up flat
lines got a little dip and then it climbs up again so the shape of that didn't really change that much so it
looks pretty consistent now coming down here you can see our shift time it's still
milliseconds but that's to be expected because when you think about it we didn't change the tune so the
transmission is going to kind of control the pressures to get it to the desired
shift time and the desired shift time is 375 milliseconds it's going to modify
either the clutch pressure or the overall line pressure to get the transmission to shift to that speed so
it's not surprising to see the 375 milliseconds stay the same now over here
talking about torque signal pressure i don't think we can compare the stock which is showing 77
because you can see where it kind of falls on this line it's hot it's maxed out pretty much and what it's going to electronically
control it at then it's going to drop off and you can see it's where we were collecting this data was just right off
of that slope but on this one here it was pretty much flat line and then it started dropping down so this is showing
it at 67 but you can see we're pretty far down on that slope so the pressures are probably not that far off from where
they were on the stock that's reason why earlier i was saying i don't know if we can really do compare apples to apples
on these log screens here the ones i have for at least getting these single
pictures to get us an idea of what's happening now in this log we've got the transgo
kit installed and the tune installed you can see up on engine rpm a nice downward spike there that's actually a good
kind of indication of a good strong shift and if we take a look at the pattern right here that's the commanded
35r uh clutch pattern and you can see the downward spike but also starts climbing almost immediately
right after that up until its maximum pressure if i go back to the previous one you can see it's kind of flat line longer and it starts to climb whereas
this one here kind of climbs up dips down and immediately starts climbing up again down here on this lower graph we're
going to see our torque signal pressure and it's at 72 once again though we're pretty far down on that slope so i don't
know if we can really compare apple's apples there so then looking at the speed the shift speed you can see 200
milliseconds is doing a pretty good job of matching that that's what we put on our tune is 200 milliseconds for those
bottom three rows so it's good to see that this transmission tune was able to kind of match that
it did that by modifying these pressures either the line pressure overall or
that shift pattern right here that we see on that oncoming clutch now looking at the 3 4 shift we can see
that the engine speed drop now this pattern right here is going to be representative off the 456 clutch it
coming on you can see it comes on has a little dip it's pretty flat and then it climbs up to its full pressure and the
shift time on this is 225 milliseconds this is just stock and uh you know you can see here we are on our our torque
signal kind of a little bit down on the slope and we're measuring 51. now this is the transgo kit without the tune
installed you can see its pattern it's pretty similar but you could see it kind of went through and shortened everything
up a little bit we're not flatlined as long this is the previous one a little longer right there this is the current
one a little shorter and the engine drop is a good pretty good solid drop
and our shift speeds right here now it is faster so this one actually occurred to be faster 150 milliseconds and i
don't know if this hasn't completely adapted you know this these transmissions the more you drive it the
more it'll try to match and adapt and get to a perfect shift it's kind of hard to tell with these 6l80s because they
don't really give you that kind of information the scan tool they give you your shift speeds but they don't tell
you adaptive pressures and how it's changing i wish it did but it doesn't do that and now we're looking at the
transgo shift kit with the tune installed you can see our nice crisp downward slope there and we can see the
shape of the pattern once again it's um it looks almost similar looks pretty close to the same
and our shift speeds have dropped down to 100 milliseconds it's actually too quick of a shift my guess is we drive it
enough and i actually lengthen this out and change that around actually you have to slow down some here we can see our
our torque signal pressure and it's controlling it at 56. might actually continuously be lowering that pressure
to get that clutch to apply a little bit slower to get that shift time closer to 200 milliseconds so as you can see not
only can we use hp tuners to modify our shift tables and our pressures and other parameters within our transmission
control but we can also use the scanner function and go through and monitor all this stuff and it kind of gives us the
ability to not only diagnose but to give us a log of changes so we can go back
and compare if needed special thanks goes to transgo for providing that kit and also a double
special thanks to arleigh for doing all that heavy work and if you guys have any questions please feel free to comment

hello my name is sean boyle and i work
at southern illinois university in their
automotive technology program and we are
going to look at 6l80 6l90
transmission tuning and the displacement
on demand
and we're trying to figure out a way to
make these torque converters
live in these transmissions so this
video is going to be broken up into
three sections this first section we're
going to talk about displacement on
demand
and we're going to cover how it affects
transmission operation and also
what happens when it fails and the
second part i'm going to look at torque
converter clutch and we're going to take
a torque vertical clutch apart
we're going to talk about some of the
failures that could occur inside a
torque converter
and also some of the solutions that are
out there and then the third part we're
going to look at the hp tuner software
and we're going to see what technicians
commonly do
to modify these transmission control
modules so that these transmissions can
live
so before we get too deep into this
topic let's discuss the elephant in the
room
tuning and a lot of people are skittish
about tuning
they read things like this little
document here that was produced by the
epa
pointing out that you don't want to mess
with the mission devices especially as a
shop
you're going to be you're going to if
you get caught you get a huge fine and
that would be bad
but the thing is if you read through
this they're really pointing out things
especially diesel the diesel side of
things you guys got to be careful if
you're modifying diesel stuff
you know they're actually pointing out
diesel oxidation catalyst egr
selective catalyst reduction these are
physical parts
or when they identify things like
diagnostic trouble codes or the onboard
diagnostic system
if you're going in there and telling it
to ignore emission related stuff
that's a a big issue but as far as the
stuff that we do in the transmission
world is altering torque converter
clutch application
and maybe even disabling on the engine
side
displacement on demand or active fuel
management dynamic fuel management
basically the four-cylinder mode on an
eight-cylinder
is that really modifying emissions we
kind of balance that
like what's the difference between
emissions and what's the difference
between fuel consumption
and they are completely different if
they weren't when they
improved the emissions on diesel trucks
the fuel economy would have increased
as well but what happened is that the
exact opposite occurred
even if you're old like me and you
remember back in the
the lean burn carburetors they got
incredible fuel economy you know 40
40 plus miles per gallon but they
weren't good for emissions so what they
do when they came out fuel injection
your fuel economy actually dropped
when you're looking at those vehicles
and but the emission levels also dropped
so the economy got worse
but the emissions got better so to
further convince myself that
displacement on demand and stuff like
that isn't really an emissions related
device
you can see right here this is a
document that art linked to on his
translogic page on facebook you can see
here the gmc sierra and the silverado
both those vehicles because of the chip
shortage that we're seeing right here in
2021
good old chip shortage that they're
removing those
functions from the computers so they can
save those chips for other
purposes and so a certain number of
these vehicles are actually being
produced and shipped
without active fuel management or
displacement on demand
so without having to re-certify and all
that kind of stuff this engine
now is it going to affect fuel
consumption maybe it does maybe it
doesn't i don't know how they're able to
just
omit this on a vehicle without having to
change the window stickers for fuel
consumption
and definitely without it affecting
emissions so it must not affect
emissions if they're able to pull this
out out of production vehicles and
consider that okay everything else is is
still there all the the lifters and
the solenoids and all that it's all
still there in those vehicles
only thing they're doing is modifying
the computers so they don't have the in
the software
so they don't have the ability of
turning on displacement on demand just
because of the chip shortage so
that right there in my opinion is a
pretty good rationale for why you can
as a technician with customers consent
of course
disable displacement on demand if gm's
able to do it before these vehicles
actually roll off the assembly line
then i think you should be able to do it
as well for me a little video
time lapse video of me taking apart to
get to the dod devices and i'll try to
narrate this
so you can see i took like the intake
manifold that's coming off there
this is a nice clean engine everything
came apart super easy
a little noise dampener there those are
the high pressure fuel lines
you're supposed to replace those if you
ever change them and then of course
here's our nice little fuel rail
that fuel rail came out super easy
that's not going to be the case when
we're working on something with some
mileage on it
high pressure fuel pump camshaft driven
the fuel line attached to it so there's
the fuel control actuator attached to it
and then a high pressure pump
like i said you gotta you gotta wish
that every fuel rail would just pop out
like that you got four injectors you get
a little bit of carbon built up on the
tip of that it's not gonna want to come
out that easy they actually make special
tools to kind of slide hammer those out
but
didn't need that like i said it's a
fresh engine
donated so this is the vl om
the variable lift oil manifold you can
see
i've got four solenoids here and those
four solenoids control
the four cylinders that can be
deactivated one cylinders one
four six and seven so actually you can
see the little oil pressure
holes that go down to the valley where
the lifters exist
and that cylinder one right there
and those are the passageways right it's
moving on me those are the passageways
that when that solenoid activates the
oil pressure goes in there
finds its way to that lifter so here you
can see i'm taking it apart a little bit
further i've got the
spark plugs out the valve cover off the
the exhaust manifold out
and before i get into deeps you can see
the oil pressure holes this is cylinder
seven
these are the rocker arms for seven
those are the oil passages that the
variable
lift the solenoids the dod solenoids
would activate
through that those passageways right
there and what they'll do is when
there's when they're energized a lot oil
pressure going there
to unhinge or unlock the solenoids
or the lifters and when those lifters
open up
these two valves right here are going to
stop opening and closing
so you'll see that now i went ahead and
actuated by air
so you can see right now that's where
the air is going in and those are the
two valves or the two rockers that
you're going to see they're stopped
moving because the lifters
were disabled and then i re-enabled them
you can see right here they're operating
and then with air pressure in it right
now they stop operating
i'm just cranking it over with the
starter motor and then take the
air off of it and they reactivate i'm
just using an air gun
and i'm just kind of pulsing it now what
pressures do they do that at if you take
a look over here i got about two psi
sitting there
and as i'm raising the pressure up you
can see when it gets to about 20 psi
right uh
all right now
they deactivate so they need 20 psi to
release that lifter
and then when i lower it back down
they both start working at about 15 psi
or so so
there's a little bit of a hysteresis or
whatever you want to say
now here i've got in blue i've got the
pressure
off my handgun and then this is cylinder
pressure
you could see i just blasted it in my
okay now i took the pressure away so
they're operating again when i apply
pressure to it you can see they stopped
moving
and we could see how it affects the
cylinder pressure and the timing is
important when they activate these
solenoids
they need to activate it like when it's
on the exhaust stroke
because if they don't you're actually
going to have a build up of pressure in
there
and it's going to work it's still going
to be like an air spring but you're
going to be building compression
if you do it at the right timing you're
going to have very little pressure so if
you see this like that pressure spike
there was in the intake stroke this
one's going to be
more towards the exhaust if i remember
right
there and you can see when that occurred
since that the the actuator shut the
valves on the exhaust stroke
so it never got a chance to take an
intake pulse and never
the valves never opened up on the intake
stroke so when
it closed it didn't have air trapped in
there so the exhaust
the the piston moved up on the exhaust
stroke and then both valves closed
and then just kind of created a vacuum
and now it's working as a little
air vacuum pump if you will
and now it's back to normal you can see
i did it again
activated it during the exhaust stroke
and you can see it maintain a low
pressure
so that's a kind of a a little example
of what what's going on in there here
you can see
i operated it actually was on the intake
stroke at that point
so that's why it built up some of that
pressure in that cylinder
so timing is important and it is
something that you need to kind of
not like you need to do anything about
but just be aware of during this
operation
that these solenoids are being turned on
and off as specific sequences
and these newer systems the dynamic fuel
management system
where they've got a dod lifter for every
cylinder
and they've got 17 different modes where
they can apply and release these things
so it's more advanced than the dod
that's been around since 2005 on the
trailblazer
they converted this over to the dynamic
system and on the dynamic system they've
got
you know a lifter for every cylinder and
they can operate in a bunch of different
modes
that's just showing it when you're doing
it during the exhaust stroke that you're
going to hold
a little bit of pressure in there and
that slide before that was showing it
during the
other any other stroke that you'll trap
air pressure in there
this is taking it apart a little bit
further i got my rocker arms coming off
so this way we can get down and take a
look at what's going on in the lifters
as far as that's concerned
and pull my push rods out pull my
cylinder head
off and now i'm going to go in there and
pull the little cradle or the little
bucket that holds the lifters
there's a normal lifter that's not dod
and then this is the dod lifter right
there
they're obviously roller lifters this
right here this little spring is going
to kind of keep
pieces in contact when they're in that
release mode that larger oil hole is
where the fluid from the
solenoids go into the release and apply
it
and when you assemble it that little
guide there that i pointed at
that fits into that little slot right
there kind of allows it to slide back
and forth
pretty cool um
and this was just because it was a
pretty cool looking engine you know when
you take this thing apart
the reliefs this is a direct injection
so they're spraying this fuel in from
the side right into the cylinder
and it's a neat design it's a 6.2 liter
corvette stingray engine and we've got
the luxury of just basically using it as
a training aid here at school
don't beat me up too much i'm not much
of an artiste so
this is the best rendition i can do of
the way these lifters are designed
this is an actual lifter that we see
here you can see the roller that
operates on the cam shaft and i
simulated those rollers there those
little needle bearings and so forth
this is the lifter body everything that
we see see that big hole right there
that's going to line up with these big
holes right there and the small hole
right here
is going to feed what would normally be
a hydraulic lifter and we would see that
coming through this little hole right
there
so this part from here on up is
basically just a normal lifter
where we've got oil fed into it it kind
of maintains a volume of oil
inside here to remove the lash or the
clearance that we've got between the
rock arm and the valve
and oil will pump up through the push
rod the lubricate the upper valve train
but all this stuff down here this kind
of everything we see in red
that's going to be a little different
that's what's going to make the active
lifter or the dod lifter
unique so the way it operates is we're
going to have
this spring right here pushing these
plungers outward
and they're going to latch into these
little slots that are built into this
lifter body and then when we want this
to release
basically we want the lifter body to be
able to go up and down without
transferring that actuation to the
inner lifter the actual hydraulic lifter
that we're familiar with
they'll put oil pressure through this
passageway there and that oil will find
its way around
and push those plungers in up against
that spring force right there
so when those plungers get pushed in now
they're not latched into the outer body
anymore like they are shown latched here
but they're unlatched there
so the outer body can then sit there and
move up and down
around this stationary inner lifter if
you'll call it that
and the valves will remain closed and
then when they want this to engage again
they'll release the oil pressure
and the spring that exists between those
two plungers will push the plungers out
and it'll grab into the outer body
and then now the body will push that
inner lifter and it'll travel and
operate just like a normal lifter would
that's the way that they're designed
they do
run into issues you know sometimes this
little latching mechanism gets burred up
and it doesn't grab
oil pressure is a really big thing you
need as you saw with the
examples you needed 20 psi to push that
in
and it doesn't the spring doesn't push
it out until about 15 psi
so if you're low on oil pressure these
things aren't going to engage properly
and that is something that actually said
dtc and so forth
but not all these valves have these dod
lifters unless you've got a late model
vehicle that's got the dynamic fuel
management
that's going to operate potentially on
all cylinders so they can sit there and
mix it around
but most the earlier units that have
active fuel management or what we
commonly think of is displacement on
demand that's going to be cylinders
one four six and seven so four cylinders
problems that exist with displacement on
demand
as far as our transmission operation is
concerned well
if you look at the way how these
transmissions are operated software wise
they'll bring torque converter clutch
operation as early as first gear
and um so first second third all the
gears all six gears on a 6l80 6l90
could potentially have torque converter
clutch application well displacement on
demand
isn't really a gear driven component
it's more of a load-driven
component so if you're lightly on the
throttle they might apply your torque
converter clutch in second gear
or third gear and then also start to
apply this four-cylinder mode
and next thing you know you're
transmitting all these vibrations into
the cabin of the vehicle so
vibrations at low speeds when the torque
motor clutch is engaged
that is a very common complaint with
displacement on demand
or torque a lot of people mistake it for
a shutter they think the torque
converter or something in the
transmission is creating a vibration
or shuttering during application because
it comes and goes but in reality it's
just
displacement on demand turning on and
off on and off so that's actually a
pretty common issue
vibrations at low speed because torque
converter clutch application and
displacement on demand
and that can actually lead to this next
issue which is torque rear clutch piston
uh the friction lining hub and the
spring damage inside the torque
converter
mainly because at that low speed and the
vibration and the
torsional vibration that's occurring is
pretty hard on that torque converter
so this vibration right here it was from
a 2011
tahoe and it had a pretty bad vibration
at about 20 miles an hour
you could see it when it went to four
cylinder mode and you felt it because
the torque cover clutch was trying to
apply at that same
speed or around that speed i use this
little homemade vibration analyzer that
we make and we use in some of our
classes and
i there's a link up there to it you can
go through and see how to make it
yourself if you have a scope
like i said 20 bucks or so you can make
this analyzer it's pretty cheap and it's
effective
it's three axes so x y and z i i
measured all three when i was doing this
i just drove and put this on the
steering wheel while i was going down
the road
and when this thing went into four
cylinder mode it created a nice
rhythmic pulsation so in this video you
could see that
this thing is operating four cylinder
mode you can kind of tell by this
rhythmic pulsation that's occurring here
and when the switch is the eight
cylinder mode you're gonna see it's
gonna get more random
so you can tell right there switch to
eight cylinder mode remind you i had
this on the steering wheel so i'm
feeling every bump and even every turn
but you can tell when this thing acts up
and it's really only acted up and
created a
noticeable vibration at low speeds right
there you can see it went to four
cylinder mode
and because when we're driving this
thing if i had a camera in there i
wouldn't have been able to show you
anything but this will actually
represent it in a scope format
so you can see there's the normal eight
cylinder mode
and a little blip where it looks like it
went to four cylinder for a second there
tried it again and it's all load-based
so at this speed it's on and off quite a
bit
and then you can see it's turned it on
for a little length your time but it's
it's
amazing when you're driving at 20 miles
an hour that it switches between eight
cylinder four-cylinder mode just for
like a second or two so it's obviously
not an effective
um device either fuel consumption or
definitely emissions device
when you're driving that slow and the
things kicking on and off but it
definitely creates drivability
complaints
so that's the reason why when you look
if you were to guess when this thing
turned on
right there you're in four cylinder mode
and then it turned back off
if i were to drive highway speeds i
wouldn't pick this up because engine
speed is going fast enough
vehicles going fast enough i wouldn't
actually be able to see it wouldn't be
an extreme vibration and wouldn't be a
nuisance that one there you could tell
you'll feel it and hear it in the
vehicle
so that concludes part one of this
three-part video series
we just covered displacement on demand
the next video is going to cover
torque converter clutches and i'm going
to take a torque of it apart in front of
you
we're going to show all the pieces and
parts talk about what fails inside them
talk about some after-market solutions
and i'm going to give you my opinions
on some of the things that i would do if
i was overhauling a 6l80 and i was
concerned about the torque rotor clutch
so see you in part two
You said:
this is the second part of a three-part
series on the gm 6l80
displacement on demand torque converter
clutch and hp tuners video
and in this video we're going to take
apart a torque converter i'm going to
show you all the internal parts
show you what commonly fails and also
show you some solutions that are out
there for the aftermarket
and give you some idea of what i would
do if i were overhauling one of these
units and i was concerned about the door
converter clutch so let's get into that
so here i got a 6l80 torque converter
taken out of one of my cores
i went ahead and cut this open on the
lathe as you would see a torque
converter from the outside this is what
it would look like
and basically you cut the weld out and
you can split this converter open
on the inside here you can see the
impeller fins when this thing is
rotating
when the engine is driving this torque
converter fluid from the center of this
is going to come out and get flung out
basically on this
towards the outside of this converter
that fluid is going to be caught
by the turbine and the turbine is
connected to the transmission's input
shaft
and the fluid that finds its way back in
the momentum of that fluid and after
that
the force is absorbed by this turbine
the fluid leaving the center of it
is going to get redirected by the stator
assembly
into the same direction that the
impeller is rotating and that's what
gives us our torque multiplication
without spending too much time talking
about the basics of torque
clutch operation and torque converter
operation you can click on this video up
here
that takes you to a video that i've made
on how torque converters operate their
construction
and how torque river clutches operate so
getting more specifically into the 6l80
we're going to focus primarily on this
torque converter clutch
apply piston with this friction material
here this is a woven carbon
material it allows actually fluid under
pressure
even when this is applied to kind of
wick its way through this friction
material and that kind of removes heat
this is what allows this converter to
kind of continuously have slip
and not burn up it can take the heat
real well it can take friction real well
and actually conduct the heat away from
the fluid and away from the friction
lining
other things that we see on this
converter piston we've got these
dampening springs
because when we apply this torque motor
clutch the cover is going to drive
the piston and since the piston is
splined
to the turbine when that is applied and
the piston is actually
get on there when that piston is applied
to the converter cover
it's going to deliver engine torque
through the cover through the piston
through the springs
and then right to the input shaft so we
need to have these springs in there to
help dampen
and cushion out those torsional
vibrations now that you've learned a bit
about the
displacement on demand you can see where
that's a really important feature
and it's also going to create a lot of
activity going on in here with this hub
because of that the vibration pulses
that we can run into when we switch to
four-cylinder mode
so this converter piston right here this
store converter clutch piston
has a number of issues one is it could
develop cracks it can
develop cracks in these windows that we
have here
right around where these this hub
section right around these springs
you could develop cracks around these
rivets even where these contours are
it can develop cracks inside these
contours
and uh just through flexing and that
really comes to the next section here
is the pitfalls of this torque converter
assembly
talking with some experts like bob
warrenke at sonex
he deals a lot in researches a lot with
torque converter components
and when i ask him why these
6086090 converters fail as frequently as
they do
he pretty much attributes that to the
fact that they're under-engineered
they're they're made too thin general
motors is probably spending a lot of
time trying to make sure
things are lightweight and reduce the
amount of metal that they have in here
well the pitfall of that is that you're
going to run into a situation
where you're going to have flexing of
the piston or flexing or deflection
of the torque converter cover and that
if you have a lot of flexing that's
occurring eventually that's going to
cause fatigue and cracks
now another issue that can occur with
that is what depending on the pressure
that they have in this torque converter
that he mentions that there's a back
taper that we have on this piston
assembly so actually machine
a slight taper to it so the outer edge
when it comes into contact with the
cover
the outer edge is going to contact first
then as pressure increases on the
applied side of this piston across this
whole surface area
because realize it's going to be
leveraged right off of this lining which
is
towards the outside of this piston
assembly so as pressure builds up
on this across this piston assembly it's
going to cause it to kind of flatten out
so if i have a taper like this on this
friction material
as pressure builds up it's going to
flatten it out but if i over pressurize
if i have too much pressure it's going
to actually curl it up
and i'm going to have excessive contact
on the inside surface of this friction
lining so
the amount of pressure that these
converters see is very important
obviously they don't see maximum line
pressure they might see
120 or 115 psi and that's probably it
so if you're modifying things and
creating more pressure
than the strength than this torque
converter is really designed to handle
you're going to cause excessive flexing
or deflection
in this piston assembly and that's going
up causing premature cracks
or lining wear another issue that they
that he mentioned since this cover is
thin and there's not much beef to the
back of this cover
so when we look at these where they
mount
the flex plate mounting pads so our flex
plates bolted to the engine
and then our converter bolts to the flex
plate these aren't the bolts
but this mounting pad that we have here
is right on the other side
of where the friction material is going
to contact and
with a vehicle that's operating
excessive loads or high loads
or a vehicle that maybe has some
additional horsepower put to it
there's deflection or flexing that can
occur in this cover under load
and what that happened what happens
there the pitfalls of that is it creates
high spots
right where these converter mounting
pads are
the deflection can cause high spots and
that means when the piston is trying to
apply
it's really touching three different
spots and
putting excessive pressure on those
three different spots
and apparently the woven carbon lining
does not like that it's not forgiving to
that
and that can cause these linings to fail
prematurely so long and short of it is
depending on this vehicle is used if
it's
being used under heavy duty
circumstances like it's a work truck or
something like that it's always
constantly pulling heavy loads
that's really going to dictate what you
have to do to this torque converter make
it live
if you're under heavy loads a lot you're
probably going to want to upgrade this
converter make sure you got billet
covers
billet pistons that can handle the
additional pressure
and we'll look at this in a second but
i've got some charts that basically say
if i'm going to build a stock
if i use oe converter these are the
types of things i'm going to do as far
as tuning and modification
and if i build something with an
aftermarket converter this is what i
would do so
and that those are all my opinion but
let's take a look at those and see
you can always comment below to see if
you would do something different but
let's go over and take a look at those
little flow charts and i'll point out
what i would do
when i'm building a 6l80 in regards to
this torque converter clutch
this is something i kind of created in
my own little world
of what i would do if i were to
reprogram or
modify a transmission if i was building
a stock 6l80 and i was using an oe
converter and a lot of people use the oe
converters because they've had bad luck
with aftermarket converters so but if i
were to do that
i would definitely adjust using a tuner
software like hp tuners
the application so that's only applying
the torque river clutch in fourth fifth
and sixth gear
but this is where there's going to be
some debate probably i would keep the
slip speeds
and i would keep the pressure stock i
wouldn't offset that or raise it
i would disable dod but it would be with
the talk with the customer
some people say don't even tell the
customer they won't even know but
um but still the big thing at debate is
slip speeds a lot of people are gonna
pull slip speeds down to zero and um and
increase some of the pressure but
with the fact that the cover and the
piston is already thin i don't know if
that's really a good idea
now if i had an aftermarket converter
and it did not have an oe lining i would
definitely
still move the torque under clutch
applications just fourth fifth and sixth
but i would definitely lower my slip
speed to zero and
in order to get that to stick and become
effective a lot of people are saying
that you do need to increase your torque
over clutch pressure
that you can't just lower your slip
speed to zero and expect it to do it
if you test drive it you'll find that
your slip speed is probably still higher
than zero
which means you need to increase your
torque of your clutch pressure which you
can do with the tuning software
now if i had an oe lining i don't know
i'd probably still use slip but i would
definitely still change my torque
vertical clutch application to higher
gears
i don't see an issue with slip when it's
low like 40
20 to 40 rpm or or so
because that's so little of slip and
those
that woven lining is designed to handle
it the big key
is is to prevent the piston and the
cover from deflecting
so that gets you to the performance 6l80
more likely it's going to be an
aftermarket converter with the non-oe
lining but like i said you can get an oe
lining for this
i would adjust the torque motor clutch
to a higher gear definitely
slips uh to zero and increase the
pressures disable dod
and you're like okay well where are all
these parts coming from is sonex is a
company
if you click on their torque converter
tab they got a lot of good information
out there they teach you about the
materials
you learn about the friction rings they
even have like if you're a builder a
torque of a rebuilder they have a
calculator in there that teaches you how
much pressure
you need to put on this to bond so some
neat stuff up there if you're just
interested in learning
and the tech resources that can teach
you a bit about
about that here's the performance
converter kit
well one of them just as an example and
it's got a billet cover
billet piston and a couple friction
discs in there so you got more friction
surface area
by putting two discs in there you got a
thicker billet piston you got a thicker
billet cover
so you're you're you're fixing the um
the you're fixing the deflection that
occurs in the piston and in the cover
and you're also
increasing your surface area and your
friction material so that's like a
win-win
of course it costs not free and you know
that's that's going to add a lot of cost
to the build but if you've got
somebody that tows a lot or as in a
heavy duty situation
i would have to believe that this would
be a good upgrade so that concludes part
two of this three part video series
on the next section we're going to cover
hp tuners and the software side of
things we're going to go to the hp tuner
site
kind of cruise around there a little bit
then we're going to go to a 2016
silverado
and we're going to actually go through
and retrieve the information and i'm
going to show you some of the
modifications that people commonly do to
these
transmissions the transmission control
module to help make these torque
converter clutches live
in these units so see you over at part
three
You said:
the third and final part of this
three-part video series on the 6l80
displacement on demand torque vetter
clutch
and hp tuners is going to focus on hp
tuners
so in this video we're going to go to
the hp tuner site download some of the
software
i'm going to show you the mpvi 2 which
is their piece of hardware that's
utilized
we're going to use a 2016 silverado
we're going to pull information from it
and we're going to modify a few
parameters within that
transmission software something that is
commonly done with uh
out there in the shops that technicians
do then we're going to go ahead and
write that information to the vehicle
and hopefully give you a little bit of
an introduction to the hp
tuners software so now we're at this
2014
silverado and we're going to look at
what it takes to get hp
tuners to work with the software on this
transmission so here we go to
hptuners.com and we can learn a little
bit
about how the hp tuner stuff works one
important area that you want to go to
and
and cruise and learn a little bit is
their forum their forum has got a wealth
of information if you have a question
likely somebody's asked it's been
answered in here so set up a little user
id
and go to that forum also going through
the
home page you can see the mpvi2 that's
the piece of hardware that you'll get
if you click on this you'll see where it
says mpvi2
and you want to purchase it you can
purchase it with the pro features
or without the pro features it's 300
without the pro features and most people
will be fine with that
the pro features will give you the
ability to plug in this little
adapter on the side you can see a
picture of it here with wires
and that allows you to feed extra inputs
to it like if you have analog inputs you
want to record
in the transmission world let's say for
example we put a transmission
line pressure transducer on the like a
pressure tap or something like that
we could feed that information into it
and the scanner portion of this tool
could log it for us
but for like i said for the what we're
using here we're just going to say no
pro features
and then credits the credits are what's
going to allow you to program a vehicle
now the neat thing is the software the
editor and the scanner
you can download that for free and um
as long as you got the hardware you can
read
information from the modules and you can
use this as a scanner
for free there's no cost to that so
really for 300 you get a really good
scanner
and data logger this little button right
here you can set it up so it'll log or
you can just do it with the usb
cable and you can drive down the road
log your scan data and your information
the scanner has bi-directional controls
like in transmissions we can make it
shift we can operate solenoids we can
clear adapts we can do a lot of stuff
with it
so it's actually a pretty beneficial
tool
but if you ever want to program a module
you'll have to purchase
credits for that vehicle and it stays
with that vehicle so
how much are the credits and how many do
you need they're 50
for universal credit if you scroll to
the top
under vehicles you'll actually be able
to learn
what's like here at chevrolet if i
scroll down they got a lot of vehicles
that you can
program so these are all the compatible
vehicles with hp tuners
so you can see this one here is a
silverado
o7 basically i'm on this line right here
07
to 2015. silverado 48386062
it takes two credits so with two credits
i can get into the ecm and tcm
and i can change the software and it'll
cost me basically a hundred dollars
once you buy the device you don't all
you have to do is buy credits from there
now it's not like you have to rebuy this
so every time you're using this if you
are going to program a vehicle you
figure how many credits you need you buy
that many and then you
you do the transaction you can do it
right out of the program
for hp tuners so like here
a couple credits plus uh the no
pro features mpvi2 would cost four
hundred dollars
and then from there on out you would
only just need to buy the the credits
once you install it there'll be two
programs added to your machine there's
gonna be the vcm editor
and also the scanner the vcm editor is
what you're gonna read the tune from and
you're going to write
and the scanner is what you're going to
use as a scan tool where you can log and
you can test drive and
and look at all your pids and and see
what you're getting and basically see if
what you're programming is uh
you're getting the net result or what
you want out of it so i'm going to hook
this thing up and we're going to go
through and go through the process
of pulling information off the vehicle
okay so i turned the key on and i got my
mpvi 2 plugged into the diagnostic link
connector the obd2 port
and i'm going to go up to flash read
vehicle
first you need to gather info it's going
to take a look to see what modules are
available to pull information from
now if all you're doing is tuning the
compute the ecm and the tcm
you don't need to pull information off
things like body control chassis control
the fscm or anything like that so if you
have
extra modules this one only has two that
shows up the ecm and tcm
if there are other modules that show up
and you don't want them
make sure you click do not read on it
and although this can be changed later
on if you decided to read a module that
you didn't want
and then you go to purchase credits to
upload
software to the computer and uh it's
going to
make you pay more potentially like oh
okay where's two credits for the ecm and
pcm it's another
one or two for the brake control module
another one for
so you can take those modules off later
on
but just don't read them now and that
way you don't have to worry about it
i'm going to go ahead and read both of
these
and this will take a few minutes each
module so
you know have a little coffee break or
go to the bathroom and come back you see
immediately comes up with a
dialog box to save it so if i say
104 oe meaning it's not modified
and then now it opens the tune file
every time you open the editor it's
going to open up
this uh whatever you had open last and
they do that because a lot of these
tuners are modifying something small
test driving it
and then making a tweak so they don't
have to sit there and reopen it just
opens whatever was open last
as i mentioned before there's a lot up
here but if you go
under edit under view and select basic
it's gonna say yeah close the window
then open it before changes take effect
but it does kind of take a lot of it out
so that way it's not as complicated but
like i said there's still a ton of stuff
but this is in the basic view and if
under fuel
you go to the lean fuel savings well
yeah i mean here's an example under
displacement on demand you can just turn
it on and off
where if under advanced view
under the uh the same section that would
cover dod
i have all these parameters so if you
leave it enabled
you can change oil pressure thresholds
and
you know throttle positions and blah
blah blah
but if you look under here there's no
setting for like gear like you can't
prevent it from operating in a certain
gear
so that's a if they did i don't know i'd
probably leave it on there you know if
they just had it operating in
fifth and sixth gear or something like
that but either way
just it's as simple as doing that
disable so it's done
and then on the transmission side you
click transmission
we've got under general you can pick if
it's an automatic or a manual
you can adjust your gear ratios one
thing hp tuners has that's really nice
and i'm not going to try to get into all
the different things
but they do have under their tools
they've got calculators
and unit conversions
under that unit conversion you can do
your tire sizes
and calculators figure out rpms it's
really nice
but like i said i don't want to get into
too much of that one basically a focus
on the torque router clutch operation so
you got shifts shift scheduling shift
pressures
shift timing and then we got the section
for torque converter
first i guess let's talk about the slip
dave we we've got right now it's set up
from the factory it's minimum slip with
the air conditioning on is 3 rpm
and that's where some people will set
that to zero i'm going to leave it at
three then with ac off
they have the desired slip at 20. a lot
of people will zero those out
the way you can do that is you click on
this box in the corner and it highlights
everything
you put zero in there and then you hit
the equal sign
and every box becomes zero for even
disable
if you did have dod enabled you can
adjust the slip that they'll allow you
could see the slip is higher with dod
enabled they're trying to eliminate some
of the
vibration or pulsations that travel
through yeah if you disable dod
you really don't have to mess with that
i know a lot of people will go in there
and they'll still change that so the
the desired slip they you know they
might change it to zero
but like i said if your dod is disabled
it's never going to reference one of
those tables or charts anyways
all right now i'm going to go to the
apply release tab
we've got all these different patterns
we've got normal
pattern a pattern b hop mode tap up tap
down and tap up tap down hot
if i click apply and this is going to be
first
through fourth gear i got a separate
button for fifth and a separate button
for sixth
you could take a look that they actually
apply the torque converter clutch
at 10 miles an hour all the way up to 37
throttle and then they'll even apply it
at 16 miles an hour 100 throttle
so you get to see the speeds at which
they apply these
now what a lot of texts will do is they
will
highlight these three some will actually
disable it in fourth too but i don't
think i would do that
and since this is tcc apply speed
and not pressure or slip speed or
anything like that just speed
i change that to or you can change that
to 318 that's kind of the max
hit the equal button and that way every
one of these
um first second and third it's never
gonna hit that speed so it's never gonna
apply the torque over the clutch
you can highlight the whole thing and
copy it
and then when you go back to pattern
a for example you can highlight it
and then you can shift insert paste it
well
okay shift insert didn't work hit the
paste button but then that basically
transfers over so that way if you're
in the tow hall mode or you're in normal
mode
your torque over clutch will not apply
unless you're in fourth gear and it just
keeps the shift speeds there
you can tweak your shift speeds if you
feel you need to same thing
the fifth and sixth i would just leave
by itself
uh they i wouldn't change the
programming on that and i think a lot of
people just leave that stock
full throttle is kind of interesting
under full throttle they actually do
show
torque over clutch application speeds in
first at 19
second and 37 and so forth um i think a
lot of people
will they change that to 318 and then
they change the first release to
317 so basically prevents the torque of
your clutch from ever locking up at full
throttle
i don't know if i would mess with that
if i you know
you could try and see how it drives but
i know a lot of people
say they do it and some people say they
don't okay so
one of the things we talked about is if
you adjust your slip speed to zero
that sometimes you can't even achieve
zero and that's where a lot of people go
through and they'll modify their
their slip rpm air map or their their
basically our apply pressure ramp so
this is apply pressure and they look at
the slip rpm
air and this tells the computer what to
do how much pressure to add if you've
got a certain amount of slip air
so if you highlight the whole thing
and um oh by the way here's a little tip
like a lot of times when you open these
up it's in a
format like kpa and you might not be a
kpa person you might be a psi person
if you click on this little section next
to it it switches all the different
units
which i find very handy but like if i
want to increase this 10 percent i could
put 1.1
oop get out of there postpone
i could put 1.1 and hit multiply
and it raised everything up there 10
so i didn't have to individually change
all the cells yeah and of course you can
click individual cells and say okay i
want to change that one 1.2 percent
and when you the this histogram that
you've got on the side
is pretty slick because it shows the the
graph and it should be relatively smooth
if you have something that's kind of out
of the ordinary it might create a weird
mountain or a peak in there
like if i make this one somewhere in the
middle let's say if i make it 22.
you can see where that
has a weird spot right there
like wait a minute that's not supposed
to be there
my mouse button sticks if you highlight
it
it points out okay that's where it's at
and then you fix it
i could just undo it i think
there we go all right so that is what
some people
do now of course some of this just
requires do a modification to a test
drive do a modification to a test drive
and see what happens
under the transmission diagnostics that
deals with things like your
your dtc's you could turn them on and
off i don't recommend any of that
because you're going to want dtc's to
help you
diagnose things now if you're doing a
swap or modification like i've heard of
people using
turning the input speed sensor
information off on a
like a later model 4l60e
that uses the turbine shaft input speed
you basically have it ignore that
and not set a dtc if you're using an
older transmission in the newer vehicle
that's a little different because if
you're going in there and saying hey
don't turn a light on don't report on it
but there is a problem that's kind of
hiding a problem right
same thing with engine diagnostics you
can go through and
kind of the people on the they're going
to modify the engine diagnostic stuff
are the ones that are
suping up the engine and they need to
like you might have a idle air
issue or something like that that won't
be able to get resolved
so they'll have to go through and tweak
that information
oh by the way yeah there's one more
thing i can point out i didn't do
many modifications but let's say if i
save this as
because this is the oe so i'd want to
save this as the tune file
you don't want to save over your oe file
because
that's got your original setup there and
now i'm like okay what did i change if i
go to my compare
i can i can do a comparison open compare
file
and i can pick the file i want to
compare it to
and anything that's got a little bit of
difference you can see here this tcc
apply ramp it's got kind of a shading
it's green i got these three windows if
i hit this button that says show
differences
it tells me how it's different these
numbers are small
because it's only how much different it
is between the two
this shows me the compare file and
that shows me the file that i've got so
this is what i
this is the the file that i'm the oe
file basically
this is the one i modified and this is
the difference between them
so i think it's kind of neat that you
have the ability of opening that up and
looking at that
the comparison log gives you information
also on what you've changed
pretty neat hp tuners it goes in deep
you could tell they listen to the
users and they modify the software to
give to adjust it as needed
if i click right to vehicle and i can
write my calibrations in my ecm
and tcm i hit right
hit right even if i'm wrong you know
what i mean so this is one of those
things where if you're
if you go through and you do this and
you test drive it and it doesn't quite
work out very well
you can always go back to the original
file or you can just tweak it so
a lot of these people that are builders
with the transmission side of things
they just have their stock changes that
they do on these
and just apply it to every transmission
every 6l80 that they overhaul
especially in all these stock
configurations where it's like we just
want to disable dod
we want to remove torque converter
clutch application to later gears
and maybe change the slip speed so it's
pretty simple really when you think
about it's uh
for 300 for the tool for the the
mpvi2 and then a couple
a hundred dollars basically for the
credits to modify this vehicle now some
vehicles newer v the newer they are the
more credits they need but you know a
lot of vehicles are only two credits so
100 vehicle 100
to modify a vehicle is not much and um
and for 300 dollars the tool the
hardware to do this
and the the scan tool side of things
just remarkable
and i would definitely say even if you
don't plan on tuning heck i get it for
the scan tool feature
it works on a lot of different vehicles
and the bi-directional controls are
really good
there's a lot of configuration involved
with the scanner so i don't want to
necessarily get into that now
the stream has already gone pretty long
but you can see when you open it up
the default layout is going to be there
and as soon as you hit this button that
says start scanning
will actually start pulling information
in and it will um
it's detecting the network that it's on
right now pulling in all the different
pids that it can
monitor and read and
then it starts collecting information
you got graphs
i turned off it had the gauges i don't
know i'm not a big fan of the gauges
but yeah you can go through and modify
all this one neat thing with the gauges
or the the graphs is you can put
four different graphs onto one graph so
in reality this has got
five graphs but i can put four things in
each graph
so i can do quite a bit under controls
and special functions
these are all the different transmission
functions i can do i can turn
clutch solenoids on and off high speed
drivers on them off
i could control the gear first gear
second gear third gear
i can engage the torque converter clutch
a lot of people when they run these on
the dyno
they'll you know put this thing in like
fourth gear and then they'll lock the
torque converter clutch up so that way
they're getting a um and you know an
accurate reading
for their horsepower curves and stuff
even though this doesn't have a
one-to-one ratio
it's still they can lock it so it's not
shifting through gears and they can
they can move it through the different
positions and
in different loads and monitor air fuel
ratio and so forth so
so that concludes the three-part video
series uh in part one we covered
displacement on demand in part two we
covered torque converter clutch
operation
and in part three we covered the hp
tuners some of the basic
fundamentals the the basic side of
things there so if you have any special
requests or any comments please feel
free to comment below
and give me some ideas for some other
videos i can do related to hp tuners or
the 6l80
thank you for watching
You said:
all right let's see here i don't know how many people are finding
this but i am going to try to
do some hp tuner stuff hello everyone my name is sean boyle and
i'm with southern illinois university and this is broadcasting live on a saturday night
saturday evening because i got nothing better to do and i might record this on here real
quick so if you're out there and you have questions on any of this stuff
please type them in when i get little opportunities i'll go ahead and look over at the computer
and see what people have to say or ask or comment if there's any audio or video issues
please comment on that as well because i don't really know if it's working
usually i usually somebody tell me it's not working and hopefully that's not going to happen but anyway today what i'm going to do is i'm
going to cover this gm 6l80 6l90 if you don't know what that is that's the transmission that goes
behind a lot of the 6-speed transmission that goes behind a lot of chevy trucks and gmc trucks and camaros and you know just a
lot of the rear-wheel drive applications just before the 8-speed and the 10-speed
and we're going to look at active and or dynamic fuel management which that is
displacement on demand that's pretty much what we refer to it as is displacement on demand and we're going to look at some torque
converter clutch tuning you can see the pictures i have here is a performance sonics converter i've got right here a
mpvi 2 which is the hp tuners interface device and i got the lifter out of a
dod engine the one that i'll show you here in a second it's a stingray engine
my daughter she just tried calling but sorry so let me get this powerpoint clicking
and going here as per usual i always need to walk over
to this computer to get things going like i said i'm going to try to look to see if you
guys have any comments um as we go but i don't i'm doing this by myself on the fly and so i don't have the
somebody telling me when things are happening or working so i'll have to peek at it every once in a while
so and even if this thing is all a bust and screwed up i'm going to make a edited copy and put it up on the
automotive siu automotive website but jim mobley there we all know him transgo
he put this up there on the translogic page a few weeks ago and it was a very interesting read it's from the epa
and it talks about tuning and how they're cracking down on some of the emission delete devices
and that's where a lot of us try to figure out is what we're doing with transmissions with
the the dod deletes is that affecting emissions could that come back to haunt us
and personally i don't think it will if you take a look read through it when you when you read through that document and
if you're not part of the translogic page just go to facebook search translogic and if you're a transmission builder
go ahead and send a request to join same thing with the transmission brotherhood that's up there that's a builder-only
site but if you read through that document they talk a lot about the different
items that are emission-related diesel-emission related things like the catalyst the selector catalyst reduction
the particulate filters the docks the diesel oxidation catalyst egrs we all know everybody does it they get
these diesel trucks and they delete all that stuff and they reprogram it well that is a huge
emissions violation and that's what's kind of struck up all this conversation on what's legal and what's not
so i don't really think our transmission modifications fit into that category one of the reasons why is art landic from his translogic page
he addressed uh or he didn't really address it but he brought this uh document up and pointed out this is from
the gm tech authority site but they actually talk about the fact that these 2021
chevy and gmc trucks they are being shipped without the chips or the
hardware in the computer to allow for active fuel management or displacement on demand
so the oe or the the original equipment manufacturers are actually disabling this because
they're saving those chips for other essential items basically in the computer and they're able to say well we'll just
ship these trucks without dod and you know that's a one of those
things that kind of opens the eyes it's like well if it's an emissions device they wouldn't be able to do that and
you know and basically what it is it's an economy device a fuel economy device and also makes you wonder is the fuel
economy affected that much if they're able to just do that because i don't know maybe they're changing the window stickers on there to reflect the economy
the fuel economy change but i didn't hear anything about that but yeah so they're able to basically the
factory at the assembly line able to turn dod off for the sake of saving some computer
chips i think that kind of gives us i'm not going to say it gives us permission to do it but it kind of gives
us a little bit of defense when we're trying to rationalize it um now other things as far as like
torque converter clutch application and so forth is modifying our torque converter clutch application using hp tuners
i i personally think that's a consumption a fuel consumption thing and not a emissions thing to me a
this is all personal opinion too an emissions device is something that's going to be
you know you think of the exhaust the quality of the exhaust coming out is there excessive hydrocarbons excessive
carbon monoxide and things like torque converter clutches and so forth are not going to affect that because
the purpose of like an egr valve is to reduce nox tuning a transmission is not going to affect that purpose of a catalytic
converter is to reduce the hc and co tuning a torque converter is not going to change that either in my opinion so
here we've got i just i went ahead and took our we got corvette stingray engine 6.2 liters pretty cool little engine
and i went ahead and took it apart i made a little video a time lapse video of me taking apart to get to the dod devices and i'll try to narrate this
so you can see i took like the intake manifold that's coming off there this is a nice clean engine everything came apart super easy a
little noise dampener there those are the high pressure fuel lines you're supposed to replace those if you
ever change them and then of course here's our nice little fuel rail that fuel rail came out super easy
that's not going to be the case when we're working on something with some mileage on it
high pressure fuel pump camshaft driven the fuel line attached to it so there's
the fuel control actuator attached to it and then the high pressure pump like i said you gotta you gotta wish
that every fuel rail would just pop out like that you got four injectors you get a little bit of carbon built up on the tip of that it's not gonna want to come
out that easy they actually make special tools to kind of slide hammer those out but didn't need that like i said it's a
fresh engine donated so this is the vl om the variable lift
oil manifold and you can see i've got four solenoids here and those four
solenoids control the four cylinders that can be deactivated one cylinders one four six and seven
so actually you can see the little oil pressure holes that go down to the valley where the lifters exist
and that cylinder one right there and those are the passageways right oh
it's moving on me those are the passageways that when that solenoid activates the oil pressure goes in there finds its way to that lifter so here you
can see i'm taking it apart a little bit further i've got the spark plugs out the valve cover off the
the exhaust manifold out and before i get into deeps you can see the oil pressure holes this is cylinder
seven these are the rocker arms for seven those are the oil passages that the variable lift the solenoids the dod solenoids
would activate through that those passageways right there and what they'll do is when there's when they're energized a lot oil
pressure going there to unhinge or unlock the solenoids
or the lifters and when those lifters open up these two valves right here are going to stop opening and closing
so you'll see that now i went ahead and actuated by air so you can see right now that's where the air is going in and those are the
two valves or the two rockers that you're going to see they're stopped moving because the lifters were disabled and then i re-enabled them
you can see right here they're operating and then with air pressure in it right now they stop operating
i'm just cranking it over with the starter motor and then take the air off of it and they reactivate i'm
just using an air gun and i'm just kind of pulsing it now what pressures do they do that at if you take
a look over here i got about 2 psi sitting there and as i'm raising the pressure up you're going to see when it gets to
about 20 psi right all right
now they deactivate so they need 20 psi to release that lifter and then when i
lower it back down they both start working at about 15 psi
or so so there's a little bit of a hysteresis or whatever you want to say now here i've got in blue i've got the
pressure off my handgun and then this is cylinder pressure you could see i just blasted it in my
okay now i took the pressure away so they're operating again when i apply pressure to it you can see they stopped moving
and we could see how it affects the cylinder pressure and the timing is important when they activate these solenoids
they need to activate it like when it's on the exhaust stroke because if they don't you're actually going to have a buildup of pressure in there
and it's going to work it's still going to be like an air spring but you're going to be building compression
if you do it at the right timing you're going to have very little pressure so if you see this like that pressure spike there
was in the intake stroke this one's going to be more towards the exhaust if i remember right there and you can see
when that occurred since that the the actuator shut the valves on the exhaust stroke so never got a
chance to take an intake pulse and never the valves never opened up on the intake stroke so when
it closed it didn't have air trapped in there so the exhaust the the piston moved up on the exhaust
stroke and then both valves closed and then just kind of created a vacuum and now it's working as a little
air vacuum pump if you will and now it's back to normal you can see
i did it again activated it during the exhaust stroke and you can see it maintain a low pressure
so that's a kind of a a little example of what's going on in there here you can
see i operated it actually was on the intake stroke at that point so that's why it built up some of that
pressure in that cylinder so timing is important and it is something that you need to kind of
not like you need to do anything about but just be aware of during this operation that these solenoids are being turned on
and off as specific sequences and these newer systems the dynamic fuel management system
where they've got a dod lifter for every cylinder and they've got 17 different
modes where they can apply and release these things so it's more advanced than the dod that's been around since 2005 on the
trailblazer they converted this over to the dynamic system and on the dynamic system they've
got you know a lifter for every cylinder and they can operate in a bunch of different modes
that's just showing it when you're doing it during the exhaust stroke that you're going to hold a little bit of pressure in there and
that slide before that was showing it during the other any other stroke that you'll trap air pressure in there
this is taking it apart a little bit further i got my rocker arms coming off so this way we can get down and take a
look at what's going on in the lifters as far as that's concerned and pull my push rods out pull my
cylinder head off and now i'm going to go in there and pull the little cradle or the little bucket that holds the lifters
there's a normal lifter that's not dod and then this is the dod lifter right there they're obviously roller lifters this
right here this little spring is going to kind of keep pieces in contact when they're in that release mode that larger oil hole is where the fluid
from the solenoids go into the release and apply it and when you assemble it that little
guide there that i pointed at that fits into that little slot right there kind of allows it to slide back and forth
pretty cool and this was just because it was a pretty cool looking engine you know when
you take this thing apart the reliefs this is a direct injection so they're spraying this fuel in from the side right into the cylinder
and it's a neat design it's a 6.2 liter corvette stingray engine and we've got the luxury of just
basically using it as a training aid here at school
and i'm going back together with it um probably don't need to watch all these just just me going back together with it
now to go ahead and see if i can't skip through that all right so now this is a crew drawing
i'm not an artist i'm not an artiste so here is a normal lifter with a roller on the
bottom like i said that hole right there is where the oil comes in from the solenoids that little hole right there feeds the
normal lifter that you would have on the inside of any old lifter so where the red is is a plunger so
everything you see here on the side is basically this gray material that you
see on the outside that's the body of it and when oil comes in through this hole
it builds up pressure and pushes these plungers in and it allows the inner lifter if you
will to release from the lifter body so that way when the cam lobe is pushing this lifter body up and down
that inner lifter is not doing anything it's just allowing the intake and exhaust valves to stay closed
and then when they pull oil away from that the spring that exists in between these two plungers allows it to pop out and grab
into the little pocket or slot that's inside the lifter body so there's basically
latching openings inside this lifter body and those pins they can go pop out into that spot without pressure
and pressure is what squeezes them in so that way they can the inner lifter assembly can
move uh independent of the outer lifter so in case you didn't know how this dod system worked i wanted to
show you the show you and demonstrate that through that now what could go wrong as far as this dod as far as the 6l8 is
concerned what could go wrong and before i get too deep i'm going to look to see if anybody's commented on anything okay
let's see i'm gonna look on facebook no
comments so far come on people is uh anybody watching
so it says six viewers and four reactions all right but nobody's added comments
that's good that means nothing's gone wrong possibly but um all right i'm gonna go
back and continue on with this now this right here this little scope image here i use
this little homemade vibration analyzer and an siu automotive
youtube page if you want to look for this just search for a vibration analyzer and there's a video
on how to make that cost 20 bucks but i had this on the steering wheel of a 2011
silverado or tahoe a 2011 tahoe and it had a pretty good pretty
noticeable vibration at about 20 24 miles an hour 20 to 25 miles an hour
and it was the customer was worried that it was their transmission failing or something slipping but when driving it
it was every time the displacement on demand activated it created a drone sound and a vibration
and then when it went back to eight cylinder mode it went away and at low speeds it was very active on and off on
and off i don't know and what problems could that cause well that twisting and torsional vibration
it could potentially cause issues that you've got with the torque converter clutch piston assembly
in there the hub the spring assembly all that good stuff so um what we
typically would no this isn't typical somebody going through and putting a vibration analyzer out they just kind of
witness it and then they they just kind of move on but and do a repair but here i'm able to kind of
capture some of that and it's a little different if i went for a test drive with a camera in there you wouldn't be able to notice it but
here with a vibration analyzer it is something that you should be able to see and notice and i
need to click back on my powerpoint because i clicked off of it
so this is the video of me uh driving see these oscillations that you've got
there that's the vibration it's picking up when you're in four-cylinder mode and you'll see it go away when this falls back into eight-cylinder
mode you see i kind of go away there just gets kind of into a random vibration this is an edited
video by the way so i didn't waste a lot of like non-vibration moments so this is
random and then when you see it kind of get rhythmic that's when displacement on demand kicked
in and you can actually pick up the vibration if you did the math you could measure how frequent that
occurred and try to find out what was happening if you did that you'd find out it's happening twice per engine revolution
because you get two cylinders firing on when it's operating in four cylinder mode you get two cylinders firing per
engine revolution so mathematically you could figure that out using that vibration analyzer so it's pretty cool little device little tool for that but
what i was trying to show here is that not only is that vibration apparent through this um
through this scope image and to this vibration analyzer you can see how short of a window
the v4 mode actually activated you'd be cruising at 20 miles an hour like if you're cruising through town or
something like that and you're on and off the throttle it kicks on and then boom pops off
there's moments when it might just kick on for just a second or two and because the conditions and the
requirements aren't quite there like right here it's on and then it's off so this was live that i was i was
just using obs to record the screen as it was scrolling across the window so in some of these the the window of of a
v4 operation was only a second or two and you could see if that's creating an audible or a physical vibration in the
vehicle that wouldn't be desirable you know a customer will complain about that
let me skip forward here i had a couple all right so now i'm going to switch over to the bench and we're going to talk a little bit about how this
torque converter can be affected by this and um what's going on as far as that's
concerned so let me switch over to the bench view make sure that switched i believe it did
okay
i think i'm about to do that all right and
moving things around like i said if i'm doing it by myself so it's a little
weird and i'm trying to make sure i got some monitors showing me stuff and i'm not 100 certain they're showing me what
i need new and that's why i'm kind of hesitating and
delaying here so sorry about that if that's messing yep okay this way i can see what's going on
all right well this right here is a jmbx torque converter
and you can tell that by looking right here on the sticker so this is a common torque converter
off of a uh see if it's a focus yeah jmbx so this is a common 6l80 torque
converter i got a lathe so i was able to cut it in half and um so i was kind of hoping when i
cut this in half that i would actually see some problems with it i did it there was nothing wrong it's
like one of those rare circumstances that when you take it apart you hope to see damage because
i like it for the show and telephone being a school that's something that's perfectly i got plenty
of perfectly good things i like some of the stuff that's damaged so if you are not completely up on your
torque converter operation go to the siu siu technology
youtube page under transmission playlist there's a torque converter video that will teach you pretty much how the torque
converter and the lock up clutch and all that stuff works but i'll just give you a two minute brief rundown here
this is the turbine this is connected to the transmission's input shaft to these splines right in here
and connected to the turbine is the torque converter clutch piston this is the piston right here this is
the device that's going to allow for lockup so the engine is going to be able to drive the transmission input shaft through this piston
this portion here is the impeller and it's what moves fluid inside the
torque converter so when the all this is kind of welded together
so when the engine is operating and rotating this device these little hub section here that
drives the oil pump it gets fluid in here but then as this is spinning the fluid is flung from the inside to the out
and the turbine absorbs that fluid and delivers that to the transmission's
input shaft there's a lot of heat and a lot of loss that's occurs in through this process so at some point they apply this
torque converter clutch and that locks up and allows the cover to drive the input shaft
really directly through this piston so what happens on these 6l80s that causes failure
well a lot of people with that displacement on demand always kicking in there's a lot of torsional vibration
that occurs so these springs this hub takes a beating and
it can generate you can generate cracks and so forth and split this this hub assembly up if
you're not careful there can also just be some cracks that are generated inside the hub assembly itself
or even around the turbine or the uh the rivets
so those are issues that could occur another thing is the friction material itself could
fail now the reason why these fails usually because of deflection
and uh talking with the hold on one second i
gotta get a drink
so
had a little tickle on the throat there but so um talking with bob warnke he is a
torque converter expert and he shared some good information about the kind of the pitfalls if you will of
the torque converters and these 6l80s the converter cover and the converter piston
is thin it's it's it's not they built it for weight for probably weight reduction for fuel economy but
they didn't build it build it for robustness so over time these things flex
and they can create cracks and failures even this cover right here
especially if you've got a vehicle that's operate under high load frequently the the mounting pads right here which
are right on the other side were welded right on the other side where the converter clutch lining contacts
they could have flexing and twisting and torsion and that can create them to twist hot
like create high spots right where that converter clutch is in contact with and the woven convert the fiber material that
you have on this converter piston does not like that and has ability or has the
tendency to fracture this lining and cause it to come apart so if you have a transmission that or an
engine that's putting out quite a bit of torque that's causing deflection on these parts
the punishment is taken out on this woven fiber you can see here by looking at that
see if that'll focus in on that yeah it's a woven carbon fiber lining
i'm trying to get my hands so maybe we'll control the focus
so i'm really doing this for the sake of people that maybe have never had a converter apart before so they
don't know they haven't seen this um but yeah that is the woven fiber and
not all aftermarket converters utilize this they might build it with some other
suppliers friction material this carbon fiber is available this woven fiber
woven carbon is available from the oe so you an aftermarket converter builder can use
this friction material it's actually you can buy it from sonic sonic's makes a lot of different friction linings
for converters and they make a they sell the oe lining for this and they use it on some of their upgraded
parts too one of the other things that he mentioned is that they machine this piston with a
little bit of taper on it and that that way when this piston is applying because there's quite a bit of force i mean think of
the pressure that gets placed behind this piston when it gets pushed up against the cover
since the contact is on the outside the piston is going to have a little deflection so to kind of combat that they taper
this piston a little bit so that the at the very beginning the outer portion contacts first and as pressure increases it'll flatten
that piston out and then you'll have full contact with the friction material but that becomes an issue is if you over
pressurize if you have too much pressure in there it'll over deflect the piston and it'll actually curl up outward and then you'll
only be contacting this inner surface so pressures are very important when you're dealing with this
transmission and that kind of brings us to our our next topic is modifying these
things so that way if you're having to deal with converter failure or prevent
converter failure what could you do what is available with a kind of options are available
too so i'm going to bounce back to my powerpoint real quick here
i accidentally closed it so hopefully this will open up okay
i've got a couple little flow charts and while i'm doing that i might go
through and take a look to see if anybody's commented on anything uh
keep up the good work thank you i'm watching appreciate you thanks nick schaefer great stuff videos are
looking great thanks nick appreciate it and um mike markwood you're doing great sean okay
well mark i haven't gone to the hp tuning part yet so maybe uh stick around and you might have some
input on that or some assistance on that part so let me go back to the powerpoint
and start doing so go back to talk about
that now this little chart like i said here this is something i kind of created in my own little world
of what i would do if i were to reprogram or modify a transmission if i was building
a stock 6l80 and i was using an oe converter and a lot of people use the oe converters because they've had bad
luck with aftermarket converters so but if i were to do that i would definitely adjust using a tuner
software like hp tuners the application so that's only applying the torque revert clutch in fourth fifth
and sixth gear but this is where there's gonna be some debate probably i would keep the slip
speeds and i would keep the pressure stock i wouldn't offset that or raise it i would disable dod but it would be with
the talk with the customer some people say don't even tell the customer they won't even know but
but still the big thing at debate is slip speeds a lot of people are going to pull slip speeds down to zero
and um and increase some of the pressure but with the fact that the cover and the piston is already thin i don't know if
that's really a good idea now if i had an aftermarket converter
and it did not have an oe lining i would definitely still move the torque under clutch application just fourth fifth and sixth
but i would definitely lower my slip speed to zero and in order to get that to stick and become
effective a lot of people are saying that you do need to increase your torque over clutch pressure that you can't just lower your slip
speed to zero and expect it to do it if you test drive it you'll find that your slip speed is probably still higher than zero
which means you need to increase your torque over clutch pressure which you can do with the tuning software
now if i had an oe lining i don't know i'd probably still use slip but i would definitely still change my
torque vertical clutch application to higher gears i don't see an issue with slip when it's low like 40
20 to 40 rpm or or so because that's so uh little of slip and
those that woven lining is designed to handle it the big key is is to prevent the piston and the
cover from deflecting so if you're able to upgrade that with a kind of high performance stuff if you
need to if you've got a performance vehicle all right so
okay it's not changing there let me do this real quick
okay so that gets you to the performance 6l80 more likely it's going to be an aftermarket converter with the non-oe
lining but like i said you can get an oe lining for this i would adjust the torque motor clutch to a higher gear definitely
slips to zero and increase the pressures disable dod and you're like okay well
where are all these parts coming from is sonex is a company if you click on their torque converter tab they got a lot of
good information out there they teach you about the materials you learn about the friction rings they even have like if you're a
builder a torque of a rebuilder they have a calculator in there that teaches you how much pressure you need to put on this to bond so some
neat stuff up there if you're just interested in learning in the tech resources that can teach you a bit about about that here's
the performance converter kit well one of them just as an example and it's got a billet cover
billet piston and a couple friction discs in there so you got more friction surface area by putting two discs in
there you got a thicker billet piston you got a thicker billet cover so you're you're you're fixing the um
the you're fixing the deflection that occurs in the piston and in the cover and you're also increasing your surface
area and your friction material so that's like a win-win of course it costs not free and you know
that's that's going to add a lot of cost to the build but if you've got somebody that tows a lot or as in a
heavy-duty situation i would have to believe that this would be a good upgrade so tuning um we're going to talk a
little bit about these things as far as tuning i'm going to go over to the vehicle where we have the hp tuner stuff set up and we're going to look at
some of these things like how do you go through and get hp tuners purchase it where do you get the software from and then some of the
screens on disabling it so let's move over there
i'll check to see if there's any questions here real quick none so far time to share your
experience now or thank you yeah no problem i enjoy doing it just sitting here gaining knowledge i'm
watching good more h power i like that that's a good username i don't have a cool name
i'm just sean okay let me switch over to the truck view
and switch my projector over to that
so i can see the screen
yeah so this is a 2016
silverado that we have here at school and uh so you know it's got the 6l80 and
we've bought the credits and so forth for this so it should work fine if i switch over to this little screen
you can see my laptop screen and when you go to get hp tuners all you
have to do is go to their website hptuners.com and it you know you'll see it'll pull up
this page right here which is their home page across the top one of the a good piece of information would be is
the forum this forum's got tons of information if you have a question more likely it's been answered
you can use the search function so it's very beneficial also
vehicles right here this shows you all the supported vehicles for hp tuners
and we're using uh chevy silverado so you can see even when you click on chevy there's a lot of
vehicles that they've got supported here now one of the things that you're going to want to pay attention to
is like right here is our category wait where is it right here 07 to 2015
i think that's it actually this is a 2016 so it would be this one
you can see it's labels out 2016 silverado all those engine sizes and it says two
credits those are how many credits universal credits that it takes to program this computer
so um okay so those are the vehicles i'm going to go and show you a few under products if you bought the mpvi 2
which is this little device right there this little piece of hardware you can see that when you go purchase it
you can purchase it with for three hundred dollars by itself or if you get the pro features it costs
another two hundred and fifty dollars about and the pro features it gives you ability it's got this little
attachment on the side it's got some analog wire so you can actually wire in your own sensors to this and log that
information bring it in to the scanner and program using your own sensors if you don't feel
that you're going to use it you could just do it without that and this is where you would purchase the
credits now you can buy as many as you want and then use them as needed or you can just buy them as you go and
then when you download it um or you purchase it when you get it you can use the
uh program um or you can use the the tool now see where it says download
vcm suite if i click on that it's going down i'll probably download it five times already but
um you can download this program without purchasing it so you can kind of download it and get a feel for it if
other people have tuned files up there you can open them up and look at them modify them you just can't do anything
with it really that's where this interface device comes in and also the scan tool function
the the the hp scanner that you get with this will work only with this so
you get to download the scanner and you get to download the editor but you can't use it without this
but okay so i've obviously already downloaded and installed it so if i open up the editor
so if i want the hp tuners i know and i have my scanner and my editor
right here so if i pick editor it's going to open up this file that we or this program that you see right here across the top you're
going to see all these different settings operating system doesn't really give much information under engine you're
going to have all these different tabs to click through and there's a lot
there i mean you can this is not something that you're going to learn overnight you're going to spend a lot of time now
under fuel and then under lean and fuel saving you'll see your your uh enable and disable oh before i
get into this i kind of jump through this let me go ahead and i'm going to close this for a second but because i kind of jumped something i
just went to the i just went to the editor because it was already open but first thing you'll have to do before you
go to do anything is like let's say you purchased it you got your mpvi2
the next thing you're going to have to do is retrieve information off the vehicle so that's the part that i kind of jump past
so what i'm going to do is go over and plug my mppi2 in
to the vehicle and turn the key on
and then what you can see under the flash tab you can hit read vehicle and then i want to gather information
because it's going to look to see what modules it can read information off of you can see here it can read off the ecm
and the tcm i can if it had other modules like the chassis control module or
the body control module you can say okay i don't want to read that and you do not read um
because you only want to read the modules that you plan on tinkering with because when you go to edit even if you
didn't modify when you go to upload your program even if you didn't modify a module if you've
gathered information across say four or five modules it's even if you're uploading with the exact same thing it was you didn't
change anything it's going to require credits to do that and there is a way in here to turn like if you accidentally
downloaded four modules you can later on you can get rid of those other two or whatever that you don't need
but um you might as well just read the ones that you need so like if i click read it's going to go through a process of
reading these control modules it takes time like right there it's about three minutes
and you could wait for it all because it's going to be three minutes just to get the engine
information off and then it'll wait like 15 or so seconds and then it's going to take about another three minutes to get the
transmission stuff out of it transmission control module on this vehicle you know 6l80 so it's in the
transmission the engine control module it's it's right up here somewhere it's right down there so
why do i need to read both is because in order to modify my displacement on demand i need to go through and
do that through the ecm and if i want to modify my torque over clutch application
i need to modify that through my tcm see
and there's that now it'll require two credits i've already applied the credits to this vehicle so it's not gonna
require me to to uh like and that's like i said not to read it but to write it so if i modify
something when i go to upload that software it's gonna require two credits and i've
already done it on this i've already purchased the credits on this so it's not going to ask me to do that
if i didn't have credits purchased a dialog box will come up and you'll have to you'll have your option of purchasing
the credits and um and applying them to it you can buy more credits like say if you if you
want to you can buy 10 credits and then use them as needed or you could just buy them as you go
so with this doing that i'm going to go over to my computer and i'm going to check real
quick to see if anybody's commented on anything and see if
there's stuff that needs to be said thanks um yeah and let's see
we got still just mark commenting on the translogic page 40 minutes already 40 minutes in how
about that and you know i really don't have to probably do this whole
download because i already have the file saved on my computer but to be thorough i don't know
it'd be great if somebody asked a question especially about a torque converter or something then i can talk about that while it's
doing this stuff but i guess i'm such a good instructor
nobody's got questions right now maybe you're that or i'm the only one
on a saturday night doing this stuff most of you guys probably have a better a little more of a life going on
could be possible i guess um while it's doing that let's
see if there's any any other cool stuff to talk about i got this
4l80 converter i can talk about oh i just heard it cycle the key recycle power so it's done with the
engine control module now it's heading over to the transmission control module after
waiting for 15 seconds
we just recently went through a transmission that had um no and i got a video up on the
automotive website on it but that has no that was a 4l80 and it had no torque over clutch apply and set a
code for that and this is the beauty of having a lathe you can go through and chop your uh converter in half of course
you gotta send something in his core the core for this was 250 dollars so
but i did have other 4l80 cores to send and you can see i'm missing the friction material on it all the way
across here the friction was not hot or burnt it just obviously had a bonding issue
and talking with bob from sonex he said that's one of the biggest issues with these torque converters not
necessarily this one but on because this one uses just a paper-based material
but the woven carbon fiber is a lot of the rebuilders are fighting the bonding
process and the adhesion process so there's a whole procedure for that
that's why the bonding pressure and they've got that calculator on sonex's website is so essential all right we've got 20
seconds left it's almost done it read the engine control module
and it's reading the tcm if you've done a lot of onboard programming using like
you know the drutec and all that kind of stuff that takes a lot longer than this does
this pulls the information and you tune it and then you ride it there's i don't know it's a lot quicker
you see immediately comes up with a dialog box to save it so if i say
um 104 oe meaning it's not modified
and then now it opens the tune file every time you open the editor it's going to open up this whatever you had open last and they
do that because a lot of these tuners are modifying something small test driving it and then making a tweak so they don't
have to sit there and reopen it just opens whatever was open last as i mentioned before there's a lot up
here and if this doesn't really change it too
much this is the engine side but if you go under edit under view and select basic
and it's going to say yeah close the window then open it before changes take effect but it does
kind of take a lot of it out so that way it's not as complicated but like i said there's still a ton of
stuff but you can see there's my little button stuck there there we go
you can see there's still quite a bit there but this is in the basic view and if
under fuel you go to the lean fuel savings well yeah i mean here's an example
under displacement on demand you can just turn it on and off where if under advanced view
under the uh the same section that would cover dod have all these parameters
so if you leave it enabled you can change oil pressure thresholds and um
you know throttle positions and blah blah blah but if you look under here there's no setting for like gear like you can't
prevent it from operating in a certain gear so that's a if they did i don't know i
probably leave it on there you know if they just had it operating in fifth and sixth gear or something like that but
either way just it's as simple as doing that disable so it's done um
and then on the transmission side you click transmission we've got under general you can pick if
it's an automatic or a manual you can adjust your gear ratios one thing hp tuners has it's really nice and
i'm not going to try to get into all the different things but they do have under their tools they've got calculators
and uh unit conversions under that unit conversion you can do
your tire sizes and calculators figure out rpms it's really nice but like i said i don't want to get into
too much of that or basically focus on the torque router clutch operation so you got shifts shift scheduling shift
pressures shift timing and then we got the section for torque converter under uh the tcc pressure
first i guess let's talk about the slip dave we've got right now it's set up from the factory it's minimum slip with
the air conditioning on is three rpm and that's where some people will set that to zero i'm gonna leave it at
three then with ac off they have the desired slip at 20. a lot
of people will zero those out the way you can do that is you click on this box in the corner and it highlights
everything you put zero in there and then you hit the equal sign and every box becomes zero
there's other ways to adjust that or change it if you sorry got a little something in my
throat there still have it but for even disable if you did have dod enabled
you can adjust the slip that they'll allow you can see the slip is higher with dod enabled they're trying to eliminate some of the
vibration or pulsations that travel through and so but if um
yeah if you disable dod you really don't have to mess with that i know a lot of people will go in there and they'll still change that so the
the desired slip they you know they might change it to zero but like i said if your dod is disabled
it's never going to reference one of those tables or charts anyways all right now i'm going to go to the
apply release tab we've got all these different patterns we've got normal
pattern a pattern b hop mode tap up tap down and tap up tap down hot
if i went back to let's see shift general you can see pattern a is what would be
considered normal operation and pattern b is if you've got trailers so that would be like your tow
haul button so then we go back to the torque converter so we know that normal is just
normal and pattern a would be tow haul or you know when you have a trailer hooked up
if i click apply and this is going to be first through fourth gear i got a separate button for fifth and a separate button
for sixth you could take a look that they actually apply the torque converter clutch
at 10 miles an hour all the way up to 37 percent throttle
and then they'll even apply it at 16 miles an hour 100 throttle so you get to see the speeds at which
they apply these now what a lot of texas will do is they will
highlight these three some will actually disable it in fourth too but i don't think i would do that
and since this is tcc apply speed and not pressure or slip speed or anything like that just speed
i change that to or you can change that to 318 that's kind of the max
oh i'm sorry hit the equal button and that way every one of these um first second and third
it's never going to hit that speed so it's never going to apply the torque over the clutch you can highlight the whole thing and
copy it um ctrl c i get one of the copies over here somewhere
yeah right here and then when you go back to the other like
to pattern a for example you can highlight it and then you can
shift insert paste it well okay shift insert didn't work hit the paste button
but then that basically transfers over so that way if you're in the tow hall mode or you're in normal mode your torque
over clutch will not apply unless you're in fourth gear and it just keeps the shift speeds there you can tweak your shift speeds if you feel you
need to but um you know some that's i guess what some people do some people won't
same thing the fifth and sixth i would just leave by itself
i wouldn't change the programming on that and i think a lot of people just leave that stock
full throttle is kind of interesting under full throttle they actually do show torque over clutch application speeds in
first at 19 second and 37 and so forth um i think a lot of people
will they change that to 318 and then they change the first release to 317. so it basically prevents the torque
of her clutch from ever locking up at full throttle i don't know if i would mess with that if i you know
you could try and see how it drives but i know a lot of people say they do it and some people say they
don't but it is there
okay so one of the things we talked about is if you adjust your slip speed to zero that sometimes you can't even achieve
zero and that's where a lot of people go through and they'll modify their their slip rpm air map or their their
basically apply pressure ramp so this is apply pressure and they look at the slip rpm air
and this tells the computer what to do how much pressure to add if you've got a certain amount of slip air
so if you highlight the whole thing and oh by the way here's a little tip
like a lot of times when you open these up it's in a format like kpa and you might not be a kpa person you might be a psi person
if you click on this little section next to it it switches all the different units which i find very handy
but like if i want to increase this 10 percent i could put 1.1 oop get out of there postpone
i could put 1.1 and hit multiply and it raised everything up there 10
so i didn't have to individually change all the cells and so
yeah and of course you can click individual cells and say okay i want to change that one 1.2 percent
oops and when you the this histogram that you
got on the side is pretty slick because it shows uh the the graph and it should be relatively smooth if
you have something that's kind of out of the ordinary it might create a weird mountain or a peak in there
like if i make this one somewhere in the middle let's say if i make it 22.
you can see where that has a weird spot right there
like wait a minute that's not supposed to be there my mouse button sticks if you highlight
it it points out okay that's where it's at and then you fix it
i could just undo it i think there we go all right so that is what
some people do now of course some of this just requires do a modification to a test drive do a modification to a test drive and see
what happens all right well that is the um
some of the stuff that people are doing on these 6l80s and on the um for the torque converter
modifications and also the hp tuner side of things under the transmission diagnostics that deals with
things like your your dtc's you could turn them on and off i don't recommend any of that
because you're going to want dtcs to help you diagnose things that probably would be i doubt it's a
mission related but still now if you're doing a swap or modification like i've heard of people
using turning the input speed sensor information off on a
like a later model 4l60e that uses a turbine shaft input speed
you basically have it ignore that and not set a dtc if you're using an older transmission in the newer vehicle
that's a little different because if you're going in there and saying hey don't turn a light on don't report on it
but there is a problem that's kind of hiding a problem right same thing with engine diagnostics you
can go through and kind of the people on the they're going to modify the engine diagnostic stuff are the ones that are
suping up the engine and they need to like you might have a idle air issue or something like that
that won't be able to get resolved so they'll have to go through and tweak that information but
anyway i'm gonna go take a look to see what we have as far as information on the the old interweb there on
facebook and youtube see if anybody's got any questions see if i can answer anything oh by the way yeah there's one more thing i can point out i didn't do out
many modifications but let's say if i save this as because this is the oe so i'd want to save this as the tune file you
don't want to save over your oe file because that's got your original set up there
and now i'm like okay well what did i change if i go to my compare i can i can do a comparison open compare file and i could pick the
file i want to compare it to and anything that's got a little bit of difference you can see here this tcc
apply ramp it's got kind of a shading it's green i got these three windows if i hit this
button that says show differences it tells me how it's different these
numbers are small because it's only how much different it is between the two this shows me the
compare file and that shows me the file that i've got
so this is what i um this is the the file that i'm the oe file basically
this is the one i modified and this is the difference between them so i think it's kind of neat that you
have the ability of opening that up and looking at that
the comparison log gives you information also on what you've changed
pretty neat hp tuners it goes in deep you could tell they listen to the users and they modify the software to
give to adjust it as needed a lot of stuff and i'm just learning too
so i'm going to go over and see what people have commented on and see if
i can answer any questions if not probably end it
okay credits are good for life yes that is good that's the nice thing about damon hobbs
said that credits are good for life of that vehicle and i think it's attached to the pcm so that way if you
ended up swapping pcms so far this just carries on with that vin number in that pcm
now when flushing the cooler on these units what is creating all the metal we're seeing well that is
that is the torque converter um kind of falling apart now one of the things that um like bob
mentioned is if you have a lot of aluminum in the like in that as far as the metal
has come out if it's aluminum it's coming from the stator that's the only thing that is going to create aluminum in the
torque converter otherwise the metal is going to be coming from the the cracked piston the lining that
falls off or fails and then you get metal to metal with the piston pushing up against the cover yeah and
unfortunately that metal ends up getting into the um ends up getting into the cooler and
plugging it up and causing issues ah orville 58 it's working on tractor and
watch me thanks and a 6 f-50 trying to diagnose in a 0-9 ford flex cruising in fourth gear
study throttle on flat road with no input variables chain with no input variables changing
basically it feels like it's releasing the clutch pack so i don't know is it going to neutral
but or as if it were upshifting to the next gear but doesn't need the next gear it stays in that gear
and then reapplies the clutch it's almost like flares and reapplies
so i was going to throw a sonic zip kit and then try maybe solenoid bank it almost
feels as if the solenoid could be chattering well i'll tell you what more h power if
you're a builder you ought to join that transmission network
as well as three groups that are definitely worth their weight two of them are free and as
you know almost anybody that's on youtube is going to be on facebook right so the facebook page um
for a group translogic and then there's a facebook group for transmission brotherhood
both of those pages have tons of um good builders with a lot of knowledge i've learned a lot from them
um as a teacher that's where you know they're basically my soldiers foot soldiers so i get to
see what people are dealing with day in and day out learn through them and share that with students but if you're not a builder you probably
won't get into that group because it's for builders only so it's it's really you know there's a
as far as diagnosing that it would be difficult to do without having more information
like if you're feeling something engage release engage release we need to know if it's commanded what's
being commanded is it only happening in one gear um are you seeing it shuttle between two
gears is a torque river clutch trying to come on and off on and off and it's and it's running into issues so
i don't know probably have to have more information on that and with the 6f50 the 6f50 is a
similar to the that one's got the external computer on it so you can monitor things electronically a lot easier
uh than you can with like the gm 6070 unfortunately you're still kind of
limited on pressure so you can just check blind pressure i believe on that and
that's about it but um yeah offhand a zip kit would
would definitely um be a possibility i'd also look at
superior and trans go and see if they've got kits and see if that addresses your symptoms
and look between those three kits and figure out which one would possibly be the best uh you know thing to throw at it if you
feel that it's really just a valve body or command issue but if it's something that's internal
clutch wise you know something's coming apart torque converter whatever
the kit's not going to fix it unless you go through and address the root cause
anyway looking at the comments didn't really see anything else the hp tuners
now now this this baby right here it's a got the dod well actually it doesn't
have anything done to it so what i would do is i would flash it and i'd write to the vehicle with my
modifications that i made so if i click right to vehicle and i can
write my calibration to my ecm and tcm i hit right
hit right even if i'm wrong you know what i mean so this is one of those things where if you're if you go through and you do
this and you test drive it and it doesn't quite work out very well uh you can always go back to the original
file or you can just tweak it so a lot of these people that are builders with the transmission side of things
they just have their stock changes that they do on these and um just apply it to every transmission
every 6l80 that they overhaul especially on these stock configurations where it's like we just want disable dod
we want to remove torque converter clutch application to later gears and maybe change the slip speed but
other than that it's um it writes pretty quick it was already that's how fast it wrote the ecm
waits 15 seconds before it writes the tcm
and um and then once it waits it's a little kind of time there it'll upload to the
tcm since it's racing the tcm that's
probably when you don't want to unplug things it's also probably worth making sure you got a good battery in the vehicle
you don't want that to fade away on you while you're going through this
29 seconds and then it'll be done so it's pretty simple really when you
think about it for 300 for the tool for the the mpvi 2
and then a couple hundred dollars basically for the credits to modify this vehicle now some vehicles newer v the
newer they are the more credits they need but you know a lot of vehicles are only two credits so 100 vehicle 100
to modify a vehicle is not much and um and for 300 the tool the hardware to do
this and the the scan tool side of things just remarkable and uh i would definitely say even if
you don't plan on tuning heck i get it for the scan tool feature it works on a lot of different vehicles and the bi-directional controls are
really good okay it's done it wrote it maybe the next video i'll do will be on
the the scanner side of things and see all the different transmission things we can do with the scanner because it is a nice
tool as well there's a lot of configuration involved with the scanner so i don't want to necessarily get into that now the
stream has already gone pretty long but you can see when you open it up
um the default layout is going to be there and as soon as you hit this button that says start scanning
will actually start pulling information in and it will um it's detecting the network that it's on
right now pulling in all the different pids that it can monitor and read and uh
then it starts collecting information you got graphs i turned off it had the gauges i don't
know i'm not a big fan of the gauges but yeah you can go through and modify
all this one neat thing with the gauges or the the graphs is you can put four different graphs onto one graph so
in reality this has got five graphs but i can put four things in each graph
so i can do quite a bit and
you know the so yeah a lot of different features
under controls and special functions these are all the different transmission functions i can do i can turn
clutch solenoids on and off high speed drivers on them off i could control the gear first gear
second gear third gear i can engage the torque converter clutch a lot of people when they run these on
the dyno they'll you know put this thing in like fourth gear and then the lock the torque converter clutch up so that way they're getting a
and you know an accurate reading for their horsepower curves and stuff even though this
doesn't have a one-to-one ratio it's still they can lock it so it's not shifting through gears and they can
they can move it through the different positions and in different loads and monitor air fuel
ratio and so forth so anyway i'm gonna go see last time go
around see if there's any questions if not i'm gonna shut her down and thanks for watching
yes damon um the as found file yeah it that
then save subsequent files with mods put your mask on so i can hear better
yeah well i'm the only one here actually we don't need masks now as long as we're vaccinated that's what the signs say
okay so i am running it on windows 10 yeah so i've got all these computers
here at the school are windows 10 because uh they wouldn't let us have that but um so
let's see i'm trying to go through the list here so i was trying to okay um do all six ladies have tour
converted problems or just certain years as far as i know all of them do because unlike the 6t 70
they really didn't go through generation changes some of them are worse like they have the captive clutch and then they also
have the the single clutch like the one i showed you guys i don't have an example of a captive clutch here
but that captive clutch one was it's got two friction surfaces but it's held on by straps and it's got its
own slew of problems so it's not actually not that much better i think
they designed it to help help it but it actually has just got its own set of different problems
all right well thanks for watching those of you that are out there 10 10 concurrent viewers on youtube
and i will try to do another stream some other point thanks a bunch and on youtube i don't know
or on a facebook i thought it said somewhere how many
people are viewing but i don't see it oh wait
two viewers they got two people viewing one of them was probably me i don't know but um i guess people just can't hang
out for an hour and 10 minutes on a saturday night huh that's all right it'll be up there for people to watch later have a good night
you
You said:
please continue adding all this info we need to the doc you are running:  hey guys welcome to another video with
HP tuners today we're talking
transmission tuning think of this as a
one-onone course on why you might want
to consider tuning your transmission
especially if you're already tuning your
vehicle's engine this video is a very
basic overview of what parameters you'd
want to look at when you're tuning your
transmission let's get into it okay one
of the most commonly tuned transmissions
in the world is a 6l80 lots of shutter
problems with converters in the world
people complain about the shift strategy
the converter lockups things like that
well we're here to tell you at HP tuners
that you can make changes to that simply
through our software the simplest thing
Approach
to do on it is approach it from the fact
that we don't want any rumble strips we
don't want to convert a lock too early
but we don't too much slip either so
here's what we're going to do I'm going
to go through some basic functions of a
6l80 transmission modification so you
can see it all right so the first and
Torque Management
simple thing that I like to do is
actually look at the actual torque
management okay there's only two things
in torque management I may want adjust
and that's the actually stall Management
on that I may bring these up I'll use
number eight ,000
here on both of
these so that takes that and then I'm
Torque Converter
going to look at any upshift torque
stuff I'm going to leave that alone for
now but I'm going to roll into that
torque converter because normally you
feel that shutter with a torque
converter and this is what we're going
to get rid of whenever you have
transmission shops having problems and
they don't like the shutter going on a
customer says something's going on with
it the nests out of 10 you can move the
lock up and take care of it so we're
going to do that right now I'm going to
show you the apply part of this all
right so we don't want the converter
lock up this case we'll say in first
second third or fourth in our normal
mode so the number we like to use on
this if you use it whatever you want but
it's never going to reach it put in a
number it's never going to reach in this
case I'm going use 318 mph if it goes
318 mph in first gear you're on the way
to planet Pluto so don't have to worry
about that all right so the next one
we're going to take is pattern a now
pattern a b and c you can look up at
what it's assigned to whether it's your
tow Hall mode or whatever else if using
something into a hall mode you may want
to leave that one alone because until
Hall mode you want it to pull and load
it down but in our normal modes we're
going to come in here and say okay I
don't want this to lock up I'm going to
do this so I'm actually moving the apply
speeds right now and that one's already
done in in our pattern B now I'm going
to go to the release well in other
videos you've seen me talk about three
to five down from the shift speeds from
up speeds and down speeds and the lock
up up and downs so in this case 318 was
the number we use I'm going to come in
here and say I'm going to make it 315 so
that's three below it again it's never
going to reach it we want to make sure
same thing
here we go so 315 is there and then so
we still have a lock up in fifth and we
still have a lock up in sixth so now
we're saying well good what are we going
to do well we want to make sure the Full
Throttle on are turned off as well same
thing here
318 and 315 now if you just lock one to
three that's fine a lot of people leave
fourth gear still locked up but if you
don't want it to lock up or you feel a
shutter problem there just go in and
change
it so we dis both of those and pattern
be obviously is already set so we don't
have to worry about that so that's done
in the apply release now in the general
Fuel Management
part we come into something special
before we go there I want to make sure I
show you one thing in the engine side of
it we leave the fueling fuel saving this
is your active fuel management or
displacement on demand this is important
in this case turn off because a lot of
times that 8 six to four cylinder mode
will cause a shutter to be even worse
okay so if you want to disable it I'm
going to show you a little trick here
we're going to use disable super simple
function I'm also going to come in and
say okay I don't want it to work unless
it's over 254 degrees so the engine
should not ever get to 254 because that
means it's overheating so I can do that
I can also go in there and turn on the
minimum vsss 300 whatever else but those
two right there will actually disable it
and the disable RPM I'll make that
zero so with that being said it will not
only not go into that mode but on some
of your early Vehicles it would come up
on the dash requesting DOD mode this
case it'll never activate even with it
disabled okay so that's turned off let's
Slip
go back into the transmission on that
converter so we got slip so our slip
stuff in here our desire slip if you go
back and look right there at the bottom
of the page you'll see it's already at
zeros here but normal driving there's
nothing wrong we going here setting this
to zero take out that slip now if you
want a little bit of slip and so you can
leave that in there but I caution you
because if you look at what a like a Z6
would have with the automatic
transmission you'll notice some C6
Corvettes that they're actually zeroed
out from pretty much part throttle on
all right so that's why I kind of
learned where I want to turn these off
once I drive it with this it feels great
so I'm going to go and zero these
out on a minimum slip on the AC on I'm
going make this a zero as well so I want
to make sure zero now I don't have to
modify the dods because it's turned off
already so if you leave it on then you
can go in there and turn off the slip or
modify the slip just be careful with
that if you notice the way dood set you
can see that's a 40 you bring it down to
20 or 10 or even zero see how you like
it if you want to keep your active fuel
management displacement on demand
activated okay now don't forget the
Line Pressure
pressures we might want to take our line
pressure here we don't want to go too
crazy but if you just do a little bit
percentage and I like the 140 number so
I'm going to add 40 to the or make it
140 and if I come down to here I'm going
say I'm just going to add the this right
here I'm going to add 35 so you notice
it gives 35 to our brace pressure 140
and also drops it off at the top so if
we have any problems there all right so
quick pressure settings right there that
you can do um your max pressure is
obviously they're really high so you
don't have to worry about that another
very important thing to remember is when
you're tuning the transmission you want
to make sure that the
transmission speed is calculated
correctly in other words if they put
bigger tires on it or smaller tires it's
going to change the shift schedule all
right so you need to make sure that's
done we've done in previous videos I
went ahead and brought it up on here
anyway using a wizard it's got a 34-in
tall Tire we'll put the number in here
same gear ratio just to reiterate this I
put that in there it automatically is
going to change my transmission shifts
and it's going to be correct so when to
write it back now my transmission is
Shifting correctly based on the correct
mile hour on your speedometer as well
okay so don't forget that little tidbit
that definitely helps on
drivability one other thing you can do
Shift Timing
this is if you want to shift a little
firmer uh a little quicker you want to
do some of the shift timing I recommend
about 20% so what you can do in your
normal mode and your special mode is
come in here and just take this file and
just say okay I'm going to take and
reduce it by 20% we do that by doing
080 so 080 times that number and that
drops it down so you get a little
quicker shift out of it you do that for
first to second second to third third to
Fourth you can do fourth to fifth I
don't nor make shorten my fifth to six
or or or anything after that on the
later model Transmissions I like them to
go into normal mode and comfortable at
that point but when I'm driving around I
like the Cris shift I like a little
firmer so this is what we can do right
here
so do the point8 obviously I would do
these to each one of these I'll just
show you my sequence
here so we have those and I would do it
in special mode as well and you can see
the numbers changing on there when you
bring them up so I would do those as
well now with all those things you just
did when you drive the vehicle what you
want to do is you want to drive log it
see how the converter feels see how the
driveability is if it shifts too early
or shift too late feel free to go in and
modify that look at the mon hour you're
shifting at you log the mon hour you log
the lockup point you can see where it
shifts shifts at you ALS where you're
commanding it if it's uncomfortable to
you then it's probably uncomfortable to
the person that's driving it so feel
free to modify that according to what
you want it to do for your upshifts and
downshifts super simple transmission

You said:
okay guys in this one we're going to
continue with our
um 2010 Camaro uh Builder base file um
and so I've shown you how to um go in
and edit the file for camshaft and kind
of what to do and what to look for and
if you have any questions you can
definitely um reach out to me so we're
going to go over here and go to the
trans section and I'm actually going to
use the blue cat um tool and kind of
show you how I go about that
um so we're here in the transmission
section um obviously it's not a manual
car um shift general not really anything
to touch um in here um so I'm going to
kind of go backwards actually so
um oops let me go here
and so um going to kind of go backwards
and explain some stuff well I guess I'll
go forwards um before we get into the
bluecat tool so the shift scheduling
this is the one thing that will really
make the vehicle Drive uh really
differently um so you know honestly like
most customers I don't even touch the
shift scheduling unless they ask some
people like it really aggressive um and
basically you know moving up the you
would go here at 25% throttle to maybe
62 and you would bump this 3 or four
miles an hour what that's going to do is
that's going to that's going to move up
when the shift happens and even though
you're only going in 3 or four miles an
hour it could be that um you know that
could be a 500 RPM difference which for
a lot of people is going to going to
really weird them out um so I usually
you can go in and you can bump your
downshift speeds up a little bit um but
I usually come to the shift scheduling
section last um shift pressures um you
do need to um again this is something
that people can get really weirded out
by if you're not careful um the upshift
pressure being what you you know would
go in and and and change so you might go
in and add you know 15
psi something like that to all of the
direct upshifts so the one two the 2 3 3
4 but not the 13 1 14 24 Etc and you
would do that for all of them so again
you come into the Y pattern and you
might hit 15 psi okay if you're going to
do that though you've got to come into
General we're going to change our max
pressure to like
um probably going to change our max
pressure to something like I don't know
250 whatever your highest pressure is um
you might want to look at that and then
the line pressure we'd come in here and
we'd bump this up you know by I don't
know 175 or 200 something like
that um just make sure you don't command
that much on the upshift downshifts
we're not going to touch
adaptivesportsmen.org
so you could come in here and um you
know you might make this
like uh Point 2
75 um and hit equals you know and then
you might
do an interpolation something like
that um not going to touch the
transition time or the desired output
torque time um the shift timing I think
is something that's like really
um um you know finite you know know like
you're really splitting hairs at that
point not going to touch the downshift
the torque converter is a big one um the
apply and release so when the torque
converter locks and unlocks um is
definitely uh going to be pretty
pertinent information especially with
the Full Throttle
settings
um looks like some of these tables
aren't used
um and then the torque
Management on the upshift this is the
value so this has this has a 100% torque
Management in it which I'll be honest
with you torque management and shift
pressures is what kills
Transmissions um so I'm going to be very
reluctant to change some of this stuff
unless it's a built transmission if it's
bone stock I'm probably going to leave
this set to
one
um so um if we go into the blue cat
tool and we open this up we go in here
and we will select 6L 80
90 um there's a couple things you need
to select in here so the shift slope
we're going to go in here and
select where we
at um 10 and up Camaro electronic
throttle you want to use that um your
idol so that's going to be important so
we're going to plug in 750 that's what
our Idol is set at also your final drive
gear and your tire size so you can go up
here to your
calibration go up here to edit gear and
tire wizard this is a 2779 Tire with a
327 gear so we
have
2779 is that what I said yeah and then a
327
gear seven
gear right and then this vehicle has a
stop stock converter there's your stall
speed right
there um and so we're going to leave
that like it is I believe it's got a
stock converter so we'll leave that like
it is and everything else is already
kind of set up
um so what you would do here is you go
to export and this is going to spit out
all the stuff that you need so here's
your main shift
table
um let's go back to
our calibration file
and we're just kind of poking around
just kind of looking just to
see what all going down so what I'm
really concerned with is the um torque
converter
um stuff so we can skip over there's our
fifth gear shift table there's our sixth
wide open throttle shift table um the
wide open throttle fifth and then the
sixth the wide open throttle
RPM fifth sixth wide open RPM here's our
TCC table torque converter lock up okay
so what we would do is come in here and
go to
copy over here to the table and we would
hit paste so it's going to paste those
values in there for us looks like that
so now I look the same and then you come
over here hit next here is the fifth
gear so over
here hit fifth okay so it's editing the
values and it's going to keep you from
um it's going to keep the converter uh
from locking for
longer which is a good thing and then
we'll do six gear hit
paste and then let's see what the next
one is and then the wide open throttle
so basically um the converter is not
going to lock at wide open throttle
which is a good thing you want to make
sure that
um if you're going to try to lock your
converter at wide open throttle you want
to make sure that your converter can
handle it so you would want to um
contact your converter um company
whoever you bought it from and ask them
if you can do that definitely at the
drag strip you might be able to um pick
up some mile an
hour
um make sure I got this right yeah good
yeah you might want to pick you might
pick up some mile an hour but is it
really going to do much there's just no
telling um so that's going to take care
of the
converter
um let's see and the rest of this I'm
probably going to leave the rest of this
alone honestly um don't need to edit
that if you wanted to do the shift
scheduling you could go in here and copy
this table and do exactly what I just
did
um so on and so forth um just don't be
surprised oops fifth gear just don't be
surprised if the customer comes back and
and you know makes a comment about how
it shifts or or what so it's highly
likely that you could have that happen
so paste that in and then you'd also
want to go in and whoops update the Full
Throttle shift speed so wide open
throttle shift speed we' copy that the
normal table taking care of one through
four and then obviously fifth and sixth
they're different
so so looks like you're not going to get
into fifth or six gear these are already
kind of um it's unless you get to 173
miles hour which if you're getting that
fast then you know it's pretty
gnarly copy
these paste those you know so there
again honestly this is stuff that like a
lot of people probably never even going
to get to just because they don't drive
their cars that hard
um but every now and then you'll run
into someone that you
know takes it out and beats on it so
so that would be the blue cat tool and
how we use that and you can save this
you know for a particular customer you
can file save it and call it something
and that way you can go back and you can
you know edit things um so um I've got a
couple of vehicles that I've done files
for where you know got a little more in
depth some of the stuff there again the
biggest thing especially with a cam
shaft is just when the converter locks
and some of the um converter pressures
just altering
those um and again adding you know you
can add some pressure um to these tables
it just really depends and you'd have to
look at a data log to really see but um
that's how you would do that so again if
you guys have any questions about this
stuff um feel free to reach out let me
know

You said:
Gangsters, what's up, guys? This is
going to be a tutorial requested by one
of the viewers on how to utilize the
paddle mode or the tap up tap down in
the GM 68 and 10-speed transmissions.
This is a pretty cool um function, you
know, because you can use your paddles
and you can um you can do an auto
upshift that uh solely relies on a mile
per hour trigger as opposed to uh the
mile per hour and the RPM trigger that
is utilized in the normal mode. So,
we're going to start. Um, this really is
for like a lot of you guys that are
doing drag racing and roll racing, you
know, and things like that. Um, if you
notice here, this is a a six-speed uh a
6L85 file. If you notice here in the
normal mode, you have a full throttle
shift speed and then you also have a um
an RPM trigger that you're going to try
to toggle and line the two up at the
same time. So, if you're maybe just a
bolt-on car, intake, throttle body, a
tune, flex fuel, something like that,
you know, um, in some of the other
videos, I might show you to bump this up
three or four RPM to start there. And
then you can adjust adjust the shift
scheduling. Um, again, logging in in the
scanner and trying to line all of that
up. But one of the um easier things to
do is to come down here under your shift
scheduling to this tap up tap down
normal. Now what you're going to see
here, this is kind of strange and this
is a stock truck file. You're going to
notice here that essentially the the one
to two shift is never going to happen.
And so if you've got a Camaro or a Vet
or something like that, um you know, a
Chevy SS or a G8, you know, you might
find that the tap up tap down mode does
not auto upshift that you have to use
the paddles. Um and that's not
necessarily a terrible thing. You can
log the mode that you're in in the
scanner and you can configure these any
way you want, but a lot of you guys are
going to want to put it in the in the
auto upshift mode or the tap up tap down
and run the car like that and it make
the shift. And here it's only going to
rely on what you whatever you set up
here. So what's a good place to start?
Okay. Um what we would probably do is
take this
normal shift schedule deal from our
normal uh full throttle shift speed.
We'll paste this into here. Paste this
into here. Bring this across. There you
go. So you can see that at any m at any
throttle position, 31 miles an hour is
going to be where you make the one two
shift and then 60 so on and so forth.
And you would do the same for your fifth
gear. You would take this again. You're
you probably aren't going to hit 300
miles an hour, but for a six-speed um in
in one of the cars or the trucks, we'll
do the same thing for six gear. This is
how you would uh set it up. So, we've
got something like this. Um, now there
is a tap up tap down uh rev limiter, but
if you notice here, 8191. Um, basically
there there is no rev limiter here. Um,
the only rev limiter that's going to be
set that it's going to reference is the
one that you have set on your engine
side, which hopefully by now you would
have moved up if you're moving these up
as well. Um, and you would go out and
you would test this and maybe in the uh
in a bolt-on car, uh, with like some
flex fuel or even a set of headers, this
might be pretty okay. Um, you might find
that 31 miles an hour is not enough. You
can run it out another three or four
miles an hour. You know, you would come
in here um, and you would maybe bump it
by four. So, you'd make it 35, so on and
so forth. Okay, this is a six-speed
file. This is how you would do that one.
Um, we're not going to save this one.
We're going to go over here to our
8-speed file. Be cautious with this on
how it's laid out. Um, there again, if
we come up here to tap up, tap down.
Now, you'll notice this one has uh mile
per hour triggers already programmed
into it. Um, and I can tell you guys,
uh, that if you are making any sort of
decent power, if you have a if you have
a cam shaft, an intake manifold, uh, if
you're lucky enough to have forced
induction, I can tell you right now that
43 miles an hour, you are going to run
into the rev limiter far before you hit
that mile per hour trigger. It's just
not going to happen. Nine times out,
especially the one two shift, um, if you
find that you're running into the rev
limiter, you actually need to back the,
uh, mile per hour trigger down. Um, and
so where do you go from here? If if
that's the case for you, a good starting
point would be your um, normal shift
speed. So, we would come up here.
Actually, we're going to go to our full
throttle. Notice in the eight speeds
though, the upshift is down here. So,
make sure you catch that. So, we would
copy and paste these and come back down
to our
upshift for our tap up, tap down. And
then again, we would just paste these in
like such. Okay. Um, and we would do the
same for the full, you notice here, the
full throttle shift speed. The one, none
of these are ever going to happen unless
you actuate the paddle. So, we would
paste these in to our upshifts. And
there you go. You would do the same
thing. You would go in and you would
test this and see if the car likes it,
if the truck likes it. And it would
really be um kind of up to you. There
again, there is a tap up tap down rev
limiter. You can move this if you'd
like, but the the nice thing about the
tap up tap down mode is that it
references the M per hour trigger, which
is again uh you know much more
preferable. Um so that's going to be the
eight speed. We'll go to the we'll go to
a 10-speed file now. Um again, just be
prepared that you're probably going to
uh be moving up, you know, some of these
shift speeds. Again, it's all going to
be on based on feel. What do you like?
How do you drive? It's really going to
be um up to you. So again, here's our
our upshift schedule for tap up, tap
down. Again, 41 miles an hour, probably
going to run into your rev limiter. Uh
potentially even on a um a stock, you
know, vehicle or just a a bolt-on
vehicle. So, we would go up here to our
full throttle shift speed. Um probably
better, too. We've had a lot more luck
with uh starting with them too low and
then short shifting um and you creeping
up two 3 miles per hour at a time. Um so
again, that's something to consider. We
go over here to our full throttle. Yeah,
there again it's not going to it's not
going to make the what that basically
means before we change this table before
we change these values it would auto
upshift
um to those values except at full
throttle which is probably going to be
anything in this 87 and above range. So
at full throttle if these were set to
318 like they were that it would not
make the shift unless you actuated it
with the paddle. Um, another thing that
a lot of you guys are running into is
that the one the the is that first gear
just won't hold the power that you're
trying to make work. Um, especially if
you have a big cam shaft and good heads
or a good intake manifold or again
forced induction, you may want to
consider experimenting with a second
gear leave. Um, so the way that you
would do that is you would come in here
and you would zero out
um this upshift and you would also um
come in here and you would zero out the
downshift. Also go to our full
throttle. Make that
zero. Make our downshift zero. That way
it never And the same would apply for
the six and the eight-speed. That way
you have the ability uh you don't have
the ability to downshift. Um so again
those of you guys that are making really
big power um you know you're you're
you're and this is this is into the you
know um the 600 plus range especially
like on a street tire like a hard tire
or something um something that's not a
drag radial. Um you know this might be
something you'd want to play around
with. um I have that, you know, put into
one of the modes that you can that you
can use. And again, you'd have to go
back to your general section and um
you'd have to look at, you know, where
where everything is uh um you know,
routed to. But typically that tap up tap
down mode is going to be your your best
bet. Um but yeah, that's how you do it.
Just using these uh these upshift tables
and then pasting those into your tap tap
up tap down modes and again going out
and testing them. So, um, this is a
pretty cool, uh, viewer requested video.
If you guys have anything else that you
want me to you want to see in these
transmissions or these these files, feel
free to reach out, let me know. If
you've got data logs you'd like for me
to go over and put into a video, let me
know and I'll be happy to do it. And,
uh, yeah, we'll see you guys in the next
one. Uh, yeah, thanks.

You said:
go through some basic 6L80, 6L90 tuning
uh for GM vehicles. Um we'll go through
go through a basic quick rundown that'll
be applicable to any uh pickup car, SUV
with the 6L80,
6L90. So start here, transmission tab.
These are your commanded controls. This
is if you're using a scanner and um
you're actually logging and you're
looking to lock a gear, etc.
Um let's see. We'll start with shift
general. So, usually you don't have to
touch these unless you're looking to
enable tap shift on like a Chevy Capri
or something. Same with the shift
inertia. Um, I generally don't touch
these. The higher number, the more
aggressive the shift. Um, that's the
shift inertia t table that it
references. So, the higher the number,
the more aggressive. Generally, you
don't need to touch those. Um, shift
scheduling. This is your speeds that the
transmission shifts at in different
modes. Um, basically this is automatic
unless you want to just fine-tune full
throttle maybe. Um, let's say you
increased your shift RPM, then you'll
have to increase the full throttle by a
mile per hour or two. There's a Bluecat
software too that works well um, if you
could find it. But basically, if you
change your tire size, go to the Gear
Tires Wizard, and let's say if you go
online, you look up your tire size, and
it says it's a 35 in. Um, you want to go
a/ inch to an inch smaller. So, if your
tires are labeled as 35 in online, put a
34 here. It It should work good. Um, I
think Matt Stafford does a half inch,
but I notice sometimes you have to
reduce it a little bit more. in gear
ratio obviously stays the same unless
you change your gear ratio and then you
hit adjust and adjust your
uh shift miles per hour that we just
looking at in shift scheduling shift
pressures. Um, so this is a stock file,
modified file. I added 200 to this file
or to this tab and to this
tab. Let's see. Then we go to upshift.
So generally shift pressures on the
truck, I add about 100 to 150. Um, cars,
you could do a little bit more. You get
a little more aggressive, you can add
about 200
uh to these tables. Um, and I do
uniform. So if I do 150, I do it all
across to all three
patterns, two three shift. So there's a
stock, there's my new updated
file. 150 is the difference. Um, so you
increase these numbers for firmer shift.
Downshift I generally don't touch unless
there's some
issues. Shift timing. So this is the
torque adder. Um, basically I
reduce this whole table by about
75%,
70%. Um, you could probably go a little
more aggressive on the cars, too. But
let's say that's the stock table. This
is my table. So, you see how my numbers
are much
um, you see my numbers are much
lower than stock. Um, I do that for all
six gears. in the special tab, which
some trucks do have a special mode, some
don't. The cars do, obviously, when you
kick it into sport or tap shift, this is
the mode that it references. So, you can
get more aggressive with this. This way,
your sport mode is a little bit more
aggressive um when you're really ripping
it. Um so, you could tell that's the
stock file and that's how much I reduce
it. So, to reduce it, you basically just
highlight the tab 75 multiply. I would
start something around there. Um,
transition time. Generally, you don't
need to touch these. Um, unless it's
like a highly modded vehicle and you're
really looking to modify the shifts and
get the max out of them. Um, on the
trucks, I leave them alone. On some of
the cars like G8, CTS-V,
um, I'll touch these a little bit.
Basically, you want to reduce these
tabs. Also, what you could do is just
take your your, um, special numbers. See
how on inertia 9 it's 0.17 and then on
normal it's 0.24. You could basically
copy all the specials over to normal.
That works pretty well a lot of times.
Output factor don't touch those. They're
all different on all the platforms. You
really shouldn't have to touch
them. Uh downshift. I also don't
touch. Torque converter. Um, you want to
turn off any TCC desired slip on these.
So, basically that's the stock file. I
got zero all across all these. Zero. My
DoD is disabled just in case. I keep it
uniform.
Zero. Apply release. So, these are the
speeds that your converter locks at. On
a cam vehicle, you might want to
increase these a little bit. Some guys
just don't want the vehicle to lock in
like second or third. Um, so what they
what you do with that is you just take
this and you make it about 300 a mile
per hour. That'll never be achieved. Um,
that's if you don't want your converter
to lock in second and third. But if
you're having trouble with like fourth
gear where it's lugging a little bit,
you know, just add 5 miles per hour to
that and go from
there. Uh, let's
see. Shift timing. We went through
torque management. I generally leave
most of this stuff. Um, on the cars you
could disable more of it. On the trucks,
I highly recommend you leave it alone.
Only thing I touch is tip in torque
management, which is when you tip into
the thrott tip into the throttle. So,
factory is no throttle. Um, what I do is
none. So, that means no torque
management um for tipping. Um, on the
cars, you could disable it, but I would
I would recommend leaving it alone.
There's another tab I'll show you at the
end of the video that's more beneficial
to touch. Let's shift scheduling, shift
pressures. Um the adaptives we'll go to
next. So
um you could enable and disable the the
adaptives. I generally leave them
enabled. Um unless you're having a truck
that's really kicking your ass.
Sometimes if somebody um swaps a
transmission and it's a GM reman, they
just have a hard time relearning.
Sometimes you just have to disable the
adaptations. But basically what I do for
the oncoming presets, so you have your
one two normal shift and your one two
special mode. Um basically you increase
these
numbers to firm up the shift. So, let's
say you tune a vehicle and it's shifting
great and then after, you know, a week
or two, it seems to adapt and it's soft
and sloppy again. You need to go through
and you need to adjust these. What I do
is on like a basic bolt-on pickup is
these are the factory tables. I'll
increase these numbers, the first set by
about 50, the second two by about 80.
Um, on the cars, this table here, the
number two tab, you can get pretty
aggressive. You can make this number
750, 800, um, you can get pretty
aggressive and especially, uh,
especially in the specials tab. So, if
you want your car to shift a lot firmer
in like sport mode or tap mode, you go a
lot more aggressive on these, you would
probably just say, you know, add, let's
say,
100. Uh then I would do another 100 on
these two modes. So basically what this
is is zero is like light
throttle. One, this is about moderate
throttle. Two is when you're full tilt,
full throttle. Um and those are your
adaptation
tabs. Offcoming I generally don't touch
unless you're having some kind of shift
flares after a shift. Then you'll have
to try to increase these and see if you
can get that to clear up. Shift flares
are weird to explain. You'll you'll see
it in a log if you have
it. Uh let's see. Torque management.
These tabs don't
touch. Um last thing we'll go to engine
side torque management. So what I do
here is you can't max all these out like
you could on like the Gen 3. Um
sometimes they are like this table is
like peak torque. What I'll do on this
is just highlight the table and multiply
it by
10%. Um, just want to make minor changes
like that. Trans output max. Um, let's
see what I did on this one. You could
double all of these. Um, but don't max
them out to the 96,000. Some trucks just
don't like
that. Um, let's see. Yeah, and that's
about it for the transmission. Brake
torque management. Leave that alone.
Um, let's see if there's anything else.
Let's see. Speedometer. If you want to
disable the speed limiter, you got to
switch this to
calibration. And then make these
whatever you want your new speed limiter
to be. Um, and then you do have to do a
right and
tire. Um, after you save this file, you
do have to do a right and tire for the
calibration to take usually. Um, that's
about it, guys. Um, this have your 6L80
shifting pretty nice and you can play
with

You said:
okay so today we got a 2016 Suburban here with the 6l80 automatic transmission customer complains that
it's 65 miles an hour the RPM is constantly going up and down I did a test drive and sure enough it has torque
converter clutch slip and also torque converter clutch shutter it's only got about a hundred and ten thousand miles
on it and I dropped the pan to examine the condition of the fluid
drained it into this clean container as you can see it's very dirty dark
this is the filter that came out of it filter media is um very dark compared to
this is one I just changed on one with a hundred thousand miles so only like 10 000 less miles
and if you look at the color on the left you see it's like a
tan and then on the right it's much darker and the pan is full of
metal particulate so the filter the suction window sits right there so all
the metal will collect around there I have seen worse than this I mean obviously this is a lot of metal there's
the magnet so it's got quite a bit of metal in this thing and uh I'm assuming most that
metal or probably all of the metal is from the torque converter because these things give lots of torque converter problems and it does have the shutter
and it's slipping so that's likely uh the torque converter coming apart and so
the obvious proper solution is to replace the transmission at this point or rebuild it
um but the customer customer does not have the money right now so we're going to try to tune it and see if that's
going to fix it I'm also of course going to put fresh fluid fresh filter and some additive in there hopefully when I
change the fluid it still has the problem I'm sure it will so I can capture that on video to do a before and
after and we will also monitor during the test drive the torque converter clutch slip with HP tuner so you can see
um see it shuttering and see just how much slip this thing has when the torque converter is called is calling for
lockup here's a little tip when you're doing this job the manual once you drop that y-pipe because it's in the way of the
transmission pan all you need is a big pry bar ratchet strap it to the frame if you're by yourself like I am today now
you have plenty of clearance to easily take the pan in and out now I will say if you're planning on rebuilding your transmission yourself or
having a Shoppers build it you probably don't want to go to the tune route because the metal you know floating
around in the transmission fluid could potentially destroy the valve body or planetary gears or who knows what for us
we just buy remanufactured transmission from GM they're very reasonably priced the whole unit so if this one completely
grenades it doesn't matter and the GM transmission come with a three-year 100 000 mile warranty cool thing about them
is if the customer the transition goes out they can just take it to any GM
dealer in the country and they will warranty it for free labor parts so it's
really a good deal [Music] just the additive I'm going to be using this Lube guard
60902 and the 19680 this is what I always do when I have one that's got
torque converter shutter and there's no metal in the oil it's just shuttering
we'll put this in there with a fresh filter and fluid and most of the time this will repair it only in extreme
situations like this one do we have to go the HP tuner route
so if you've never used HP tuners before it's not too hard got the mpvi2 interface hooked up to the
OBD2 port into my laptop USB come down here to the search feature
type in vcm it's going to bring up vcm Scanner
so this is the default display for HP tuners we're going to change this up so we can just monitor the torque converter
clutch so what we want to do here is go ahead and remove the gauges we don't need
those we don't need this chart
then we're going to right click on any part of the screen here you can go to
chart layout man my phone's not working very good for this
I'm going to go ahead and delete these lower groups so just click on the group
over here we're going to remove group we move group four and group five that leaves us two groups left
over here this is all the pids that we can get these are the default pids
and we're going to right click remove all channels
then we're going to add the channels that we want to monitor so the pids we
want RPM so here we go engine RPM
then we want everything torque converter clutch related so DCC for torque
converter clutch going to click on the slip desired slip and the line pressure
that's going to add the channels over here you have to have the channels added here for the data to be displayed here
even though it says like right here it says injector duty cycle percentage if I don't have the injector duty cycle
percentage selected over here even though it's got the pit on the graph it's not going to show anything it has
to be under the monitored channels section then we're going to go back to graph we
have to modify the layout of this chart to display what we want so group one we'll keep that RPM
speed we're going to select the what we want to uh what am I doing
sorry I don't use HP tuners very often so you're going to highlight speed we don't want speed it's going to be remove series
remove injector duty cycle remove everything in group two we're not concerned with any of those pids remove
remove I'm gonna go back to group one we're going to add in the pids that we want so
that's they're calling it a series to add series
and I believe you just click here for the parameter and we're going back to the same
search feature that we use for the channels so we're going to type in the same stuff so torque converter clutch
slip now we want the angular frequency that's RPM not ratio
and torque converter clutch slip we need to set our limits now the limits if you look over here on the graph
so right here we have zero RPM and 6000 RPM that's for the red PID
which is rpm so we're going to set our scaling factor of our chart um you know if we had this set
say 6 000 to 8 000 you would never see any display for RPM because it's all out
of range you know what I'm saying so torque converter clutch slip generally never goes above uh 300.
so we're going to set our Max limit to 300. to scale that chart
and you can choose the color as white
obviously we want different colors for the different pids so as long as you're not they're not the same we're Goods
we'll leave that as white and um that's pretty much it and then we're
going to label this we need to label it or else it's it's going to just be called new series
so label that torque converter clutch slip torque converter clutch
slip now if you make your labels too long it'll run off the chart here so I don't know how to fix it I'm sure
there's a way to fix that so there's that then we're going to add in another
series parameter it's going to be torque converter clutch
desired slip again
this one only has angular frequency which is what we want we want the limits to be the same exact
limits as for the torque converter clutch slip that way the line graph is
on the same scale it's much easier to understand what's going on because they should in a perfect world completely
mirror each other the color we don't want it white because
it would match the other one so we'll make this green don't forget to label it
torque converter clutch we're gonna put Des for desired slip
let's see if it'll fit the whole thing
there we go that's good enough for me group two and we can keep adding series I forgot
how many pages you can add to one group but you can put quite a few here I just
uh to keep it cleaner I'm going to go ahead and add the last paid down to the lower graph here and that's torque
converter clutch line pressure so again add series
torque converter clutch line pressure
change the color to a color if it's not used well that doesn't really matter because it's on a complete separate
graph but we'll make it a light blue
it's in PSI I'm going to say you know 250 should be
it should never have more than that going to it but just in case we'll make it 275.
look I'm no transmission guy so is what it is okay so
label that torque converter clutch line pressure
that's it now we should be able to exit out of this
and we can go ahead and do our test drive as you can as you can see the red scale there is for RPM as it's
red torment clutch slip is in white 0 to 300 and then zero to 300 on our green
which is desired slip they should mirror each other and then line pressure down there on the bottom
you can hide this if you want to or you can monitor the pids right here it will
be in digital format and when we want to start the test drive
turn key on [Music] connect to the vehicle
[Music] foreign [Music]
start scanning [Music]
now the really cool thing about HP tuners is the data it's absolutely
instant it is like almost lab scope fast unlike a normal scanner even the snap-on
scanners are known for being I mean they're not known they are the fastest graphing scanner I've ever used
and what most people uh have claimed but they're nothing absolutely nothing
compared to HP tuners I'm gonna try to
[Music] it's absolutely instant so if you're trying to graph out torque converter
clutch slip on the Snap-on and it's doing shutter you're never going to see
it I mean you might if it's really bad but generally it doesn't update fast enough but this you will absolutely see
uh See the shutter so now it's time for test drive
now the cool thing about HP tuners you can take as long of a log as you want to you can drive for a week as long as your
computer can hold the information there's been several people who have done several hour long drives and logged
the whole thing so don't worry about running out of room here and once you're done all you have to do is go up to the
Blue Square click stop scanning and it's going to save everything and you can click anywhere on here and wherever that
little line is that you put it's going to give you the
all the readouts there so that's really nice and you can also scroll back
this is only about a 30 second capture but if you had a longer capture say a
four hour capture it's got a scroll bar here and you can scroll back and view
all your data from start to finish now one thing I'm going to do on the
test drive before I even tune it just to make sure because I don't want to waste tuner credits in my time trying to tune this
thing if it will not hold lock up is if you click this green button here it's called Uh
vehicle controls and special functions it allows you to do output controls and
when you command something it happens it's not like a Snap-On scanner where if
you command a starter relay and the engine's already running it's not going to let you engage your starter relay because then you just be grinding the
starter and could mess something up if you click on something here it's going to happen so make sure don't click on
anything unless you absolutely know this can be safer to do so if you were to go over here to the transmission
torque converter clutch and lock this thing it's gonna lock so if you got this thing
in drive and you're sitting here it's gonna it's gonna probably kill the motor or take off on you one or one or the
other but what it enables me to do is while I'm driving down the road is I can
just go ahead and go over here and lock this thing fully and make sure it holds zero RPM worth of lock if it's still
slipping when I got this on then there's likely no way that my tune's going to
help this thing it might because my tune I'm increasing the line pressure that it's going to be sending to the torque
converter clutch I don't know what type of pressure it sends to it with HP tuners
uh if it sends more than normal or what but I haven't had one yet that I have
clicked on button and it did not hold and these are these have been transmissions in worse shape than the
one I just showed you with with the metal in the pan they had even more metal and they were still able to hold
lock with just clicking this on button without without even doing the tune so I want to make sure that it it will work
before I even tune this thing okay so I'm gonna go ahead and slowly
start accelerating now these things use torque converter clutch lock up in second gear all the way through sixth
and hopefully you'll see oh you see that it just went up and down a little bit there I'm barely on the throttle
oh I just shuttered right there try to get the speed in there so you know how fast I'm going here
we go this will work better wide lens
now customer mainly complained at 65 but it does it at other speeds as well
okay right there it's not much right there but about uh
50 rpm on the attack or so
okay so here's the data log I did change the RPM from 6000 to 2750 as I realized
that I'm not going to be going over 3000 RPM and then this test or even 2700 RPM so
it's easier to see what's going on here so this is when it was pretty cold leaving the shop and so we have a torque
converter clutch desired slip that line is going to be 20 RPM we're
slipping 42. we come over here where it Peaks we're slipping 231
and this is at constant throttle we're just barely cruising out I was probably doing about 30 miles an hour here and
down here we can watch our torque River clutch line pressure and as you can see line pressures pretty constant here
the desired slip is constant obviously because the pressure is constant but our
slip is going everywhere this is when it was shuttering pretty bad so right here we have 158 RPM when we want 20. over
here well you know it's gonna be hard oh 305
slip RPM one in 20 and down here we still had
62 PSI of line pressure and if you
scroll through you can see that the line pressure on this torque converter it never goes
above about you know 70 PSR so it's uh I don't even
know if it hit 70 let me see 71 PSI
so I think that's why uh my tune works so well because I really cranked the pressure up to that converter
I'm telling it's in like 200 PSI you know if it's even capable of doing
that it all depends on how much pressure the pump's gonna output and a whole bunch of different factors but
the Factory's not really sending much to it because they're wanting it to slip they want it to slip 20 RPM for that
Ultra smooth ride and so you don't feel any um you know a little bit of vibration in
the engine well I don't really care about that I'm gonna call for full lock up like it was in the
past on the older Transmissions okay now I'm gonna go ahead and command
converter lock as you can see our white line which is converter slip is
going all over the place and lock it right now
so we have now gone down to zero RPM of slip now what I want to do is go ahead and
load it up and uh I'm not sure you can see the line pressure went off the chart I'll have to
rescale the chart and see how much pressure that's supposedly sending that converter clutch but
you slow down here some and one more throttle
I'd say it is a tune eligible
so according to the scanner we are running 594 PSI torque converter clutch pressure obviously that's uh fake it's
just it's just commanding it Max but there's no way of course that it can actually have that much pressure going
to the torque converter [Music] okay so I'm back at the shop ready to tune this thing
now you go ahead and type in vcm this time you're going to click on vcm editor
then up here read vehicle
read
[Music] and now once this is all done it's going to have all of our data pulled up
so as soon as it gets done loading you can go ahead and disconnect it from the car plug your laptop back in and do the
tuning outside the car which is what you want to do because you're going to be here for a little while uh you're gonna go up to transmission
torque converter click on that tab it opens up this and you have two tabs here you got your general Tab and your apply
release I have another video on YouTube showing what I had changed on another
6l80 to fix this same problem um but you know it looked a little
different here like it did not have an apply release I think just said like first through fourth gear or something
it's still the same concept as the other the other video being that you want the
apply to be at 318 miles an hour because that's what the default setting was for
anything that's not used so let's say four wheel drive low we're never going to use converter lockup so uh well
apparently they do me go to uh okay so sixth gear four wheel four wheel
drive low this is the OEM parameters it wants to apply converter lock and sixth gear at
318 miles an hour obviously it's never going to go that fast that's just the parameter they use to basically disable
converter lockup and then your release always wants to be 317 it needs to be a
lower number uh for it to work right so we're going to go through here and the apply release
we're not going to touch fifth and sixth because we want the converter to still work in fifth and sixth to build less
heat of course we're going to be going full lock up but in first through fourth I want to completely disable converter
lockup uh because the converter is on its last leg we only want to use it when
we need to so fifth and sixth which are going to be your overdrive gears
um and so to do it you just click apply here and you're going to highlight this
whole section here like I said 318 miles per hour
hit enter okay that didn't work uh
there you go hit replace which is equal and now it's going to be 318.
and you're going to repeat this for all of the applies for the releases you're going to
highlight and go 300 17.
and I didn't even click on it sorry I don't use HP tuners too often so 317 I'm
going to apply that and then back down to the next we're not going to hit fifth like I said or sixth
um the D2 and D1 same thing is going to be uh watch out this one's going to be your applies on the top half so 318
miles per hour with your release being on the bottom
half which is going to be the 317 miles per hour
repeat for the rest of this okay so we're done with the apply
release tab all the boxes in red are ones that I change the blues are the
ones that I have not changed so like this one I did not have to change because under apply it's already at 318
miles per hour so that's all disabled so like I said all the Reds had to click on
and change but all this was already set correct this was correct but all these had to be
changed to 318 enable 317 disable
so now that we're all done with this tab what we have done is we have disabled torque converter clutch Lockup in first
through fourth gear period now it's only going to lock and fifth and sixth we're going to go to General
and our Max Pressure they have it set at 953 kilopascals
which is equal to 138 PSI we're going to crank this up to 200 PSI
which is equal to 1 378. kilopascal
hit enter now we're done
come down here to regulator gain I was never able to find out what this meant like I said in the other video I
would just change this to one because that's what a lot of people on the internet recommended
and all I gotta say is what I've done here and what I did in the previous video it worked worked very well
the car drove nicely it was not violent going into into lockup but it also did
not slip it just it worked really well he couldn't he couldn't really tell any difference in the way it it drove
compared to what a factory transmission tune would would drive like a regulator offset that's supposed to be the minimum
pressure that the converter has on it during lock up now if you just
take your mouse and you put it over any of these bids or you know any of these tabs it gives you a little description
down here so let's see what it says for regulator offset torque converter clutch pressure regulator offset the offset let's see
I'm not sure what that means but everybody said that that's the minimum pressure and I cranked it up to 620
kilopascals last time it worked good from Nissan
keep that same um now the apply ramp
this one's a little different than the other 6l80 I had which was 320
down here so on the top of the chart the x-axis is
going to be slip RPM error not slip RPM but the error RPM y-axis is going to be
engine RPM one of the uh you know somebody commented on my other videos saying that
all this in here is uh is a is a pressure that's that it's going to go to
at this slip RPM I do not think they are right you know it's it's in kilopascals
so one kilopascal is equal to like a quarter of a PSI
so if this is slip RPM error and say we wanted 20 slip RPM which is what
um during the test drive it showed that it wanted most of the time was 20 slip RPM and it had 20 slip RPM that would
give us a slip RPM error of zero where you know we're right on the money so if that were the case and and we now have
reached zero error RPM why would it drop the converter pressure to only a quarter
PSI that makes no sense so I'm not sure exactly how this table works like I said I'm not genius at tuning or a
transmission expert but I do know that if we have a 400 RPM error
and we're at high RPM it's going to be calling for as much lockup as it can get pretty much so on
the other video this was 320. I applied this to all of these tables and that's what I'm
going to do here this one's 445 so we're gonna we're gonna Max this out at 445
apply this is going to be negative slip RPM so
like when you're coasting and so I in my previous video I wasn't
really concerned about it but you know I was I thought about it some more and I'd rather have that converter
locked up 100 when it's calling for lock up even on Coast Let Us slip the better
because this thing's already got metal going throughout the transmission so we want to keep this
we're gonna apply and we're gonna completely Max this out I'm gonna leave that at 1.0 because the
way I see this this is almost like a multiplication factor of some sort I'm not sure
um but I know this worked really well on the transmission that I that I had
previously so I'm gonna just gonna do this here at 445 on all
these tables
the desired pressure we're gonna Max this out as well
uh actually we're gonna go back to our Max Pressure here we had 1 378
I'm going to put our desired pressure at one thousand 378 we're going to give it all the
pressure that we can give it
and like I said in my other video it's not like you're going to blow the torque converter up the pump on this thing probably maxes out a couple hundred PSI
and it's going to be no different than if your converter clutch solenoid were to stick wide open and if that happens
it's not going to blow up the converter it's not going to mess anything up it only seals out so there should be no
reason you couldn't increase the max pressure to Infinity it's not you shouldn't mess anything up
then we're going to go over here to our torque converter clutch desired slip we shouldn't have to worry about first
second third fourth because we already disabled that in the apply release tab but we are running converter in fifth
and sixth so we want to have zero RPM of slip
anytime we're calling for converter so x-axis is RPM y-axis is engine torque so I don't
care everything's going to get 0 RPM
foreign slip for everybody
same thing with the sixth gear zero RPM of slip
in all situations that we're calling for lockup
minimum slip AC on get down to zero
and we're going to disable DOD which I think is very important because if you
are not running converter or if you're locking the converter 100 you're going
to have less torque going up the hills and stuff because it's no longer going to be able to unlock that converter to
say a couple hundred RPM worth of slip to get you over the hill and so we're going to want all eight cylinders firing
at all times because if we were in force Owner Mode running full lock up uphill it's not gonna like that at all to
disable dod you just go over here to engine and let's see I think it's in
fuel and lean fuel saving DOD
disable so that's that's all you got to do there it's not going to throw any check engine lights nothing like that go
back to trans here and so we're not gonna worry about any of the dod stuff because we're not
running DOD that doesn't apply um vehicle speed minimum I'm gonna set
this 35 because there's no reason you should ever run lock up in my opinion under that uh vehicle speed
before we install the tune always make sure to have a battery charger hooked up on just the low setting the higher you
go on on at least this battery charger the more alternating current you have in your system and I think the parameters
are you don't want like any more absolutely no more than like 100 millivolts of AC I could be wrong but
this charger here puts out about 70 millivolts of ac they do have specific Chargers meant for flashing Vehicles
that's ideally what you would use but so far I haven't had any problems with uh
HP tuners using just a pretty basic battery charger on the low setting that
produces very a little ac voltage when you come over here and it's going to
have right vehicle and you're going to need credits to do this so show license options
connect interface it is connected it says I have two credits available oh
there we go so here we go we're gonna click on
the credits I have okay are you sure yes
and now we just gotta ride it
another very important note do not have your laptop plugged in to charge when
you're doing this if there's any voltage Spike on the uh an incoming line voltage to
the laptop Transformer it's going to have a voltage Spike going to the laptop
and has been known to completely brick ecms and all sorts of modules in the
vehicle if that were to happen so you want a laptop with a good battery never never read tuning uh you know you can
upload a tune file from the vehicle with the laptop probably without any problems but if you're actually tuning it you're
riding the tune to the vehicle make sure you're on battery power and that's it
okay so now time for the final test drive
[Music]
it's perfect it's calling for lock up right now so we're in lock up I'm I'm watching the
data and we're at zero RPM of slip is holding zero RPM we're going up a
slight Hill right now
flat now we're back in a hill
it's maintaining
smooth no shutter still zero RPM of slip now we're going
back down a hill again okay so let's look at our data now after the tune has been done so as you can see
the white Tracer that's converter slip when we call for lock up down here
which now we have 110 PSI pressure going to the torque converter which we had only about 70 Max remember now we're at
110 even though I set the pressure Max at 200 after the computer did all of its calculations and stuff it's only sending
110 but it's either on or off there's no more ramping it trying to get slip it's
like old school it's either on or off and that's the way I like it so here we have converter slip it immediately drops
when the converter is called for and it drops down to
pretty much zero so the white Tracer here is where we're going to get our measurements and we're at 0.3
I'm just dragging it right here as you can see as I drag my finger
slip RPM stays very close to zero and it stays that way until the converter is no
longer calling for lock up so we can keep going this is a very long test
drive here probably about five minutes long or so and when we finally unlocked the
converter during coast and then of course this is when we're at idle and such so obviously we're going to have a
lot of slip RPM right here but it drove good you can hardly tell a difference
you can't I can't really tell much of a difference at all during acceleration uh
during D cell you barely feel a little bit of a of a downshift thing going on uh but it is totally reasonable and it
is way better than paying several thousand dollars for a new transmission so be curious to see
how much life the customer can can get out of it now because it only has it actually only has a hundred thousand
miles so that's pretty pretty bad that they only go that some of them only make it that far before torque torque
converter failure
You said:
all right guys so here I have a file off of a uh 2014 Silverado and this is the
fourth right or the F fourth rision
and this one uh is from my c my cousin Junior shop
and uh he changed valve bodies two converter dealer converter Billet
converter and uh some other stuff and
uh the pump as well and the problem that this truck has uh it was surging and you will get
this uh this surging uh Vehicles every now and then and as you can see right here where I'm about to uh to uh play
right now I'm going to press play and and uh it's very annoying I mean you're
very light throttle if you see the throttle is only like 30 30% throttle and uh up here you can see the the
accelerator pedal in Orange is completely flat and you'll see the throttle and the accelerator pedal or
the throttle and the RPM kind of Follow The Surge over here uh the throttle body
itself is just following what's going down over here and you see surging between 16 lb and the 22 lb around there
and uh the RPM I mean you can see it on the needle sometimes you don't feel it
but if we go forward a little bit you're going to see that on some occasions it
gets a little bit out of hand like right here it just slips a lot like 200 or 250
RPM and then you can see the pressure ramp up to about 45 lbs uh so this is a
introduction uh I guess we can introduce it with this little short clip right here but this is going to be the
introduction for the ultimate tuning guide on torque clutch issues and uh as
you see here uh my buffer line right here this is a
surge that is very common and then you will see the shutters and this is a shutter right
here so you're going to see that and then you're going to see that it it went it lost control of Tober
clutch and he shuttering uh a dealer converter was put on there uh the dealer
converter was doing this as well and the shutters were the aftermarket clutches
or the aftermarket torque converters and uh we use the blue
company converter there's two different shades of blue so there's two companies that painted blue uh but one of them is
kind of worse than the others but I mean it seems like all the T converter companies the aftermarket companies so
they have issues with their friction material somehow either they're whoever
they're supp supplying their clutches for their tur converter it's not the right one or it's not made right or it's
not cured right or something's going on with it the dealer converter was not shuttering but it was cycling like this
on and off and it could be a piston problem it could be cuz they already remanufactured the de converters already
manufactured as well now they're not brand new I mean it's hard to get a brand new toil converter
all right I'm going go ahead and uh and pause this and we're going to go to another one and
uh uh it's going to be a front wheeel drive where you're going to see the uh
the shutter more pronounced and then we're going to go to the editor all right so this is another 2014
let me see I I lost it I pressed the space bar and somehow I lost it but
let's open this back up all right right I'm going to go forward I'm going to go to where this is a blue torque converter
one of the blue ones and is struggling as you can see here it's struggling right there but
then it goes stable right here now I'm going to press play and all those little
uh bumps are shutters so here we have we are at 46 45 lbs and the truck like when
uh on the side of the road here in Texas when when you be Veer off the road a little bit uh if you're falling asleep
traveling uh there's some marks on the side of the road by the by the shoulder
and uh it goes like when you when you're almost off the road but that's what it
feels like and this is a real long shutter as you see here it's just
going and it's very very annoying and that's that's the back clutch that's the
wrong clutch now here it lowered the pressure press and you see it's commanding 20 lb when it goes into DOD
right here uh if you see right here it's commanding 40 RPM slip 40 RPM is DoD 20
is non dood and uh it got it kind of got better right
there it's not shuttering as much but right here you can see it's it's it's
out of control here it goes from uh DOD non dood and it's just out of control you
can see the it's hovering it's hovering uh high pressure and it's trying to
control the clutch and it's just it looses control and that's the problem
with this clutches I mean you can see this is this is terrible right here this is very very bad and the the computer's
trying to control the torque converter and he grabs and catches and gets loose he cuts loose and he shutters and he
does all kinds of crazy stuff all right well let's look for the uh prover
or Aradia is one of
those all right let's see 2014 no where I'm at 2016 bu
conclave this is very bad this is very very bad so here we are uh arlay is
engaged in third gear so here we are this uh yellow one over here or the
orange one it's a third gear and after third it'll start engaging now right
here it started it kind of felt like a shutter but it it was kind of all right
let me go ahead and play a little bit and we're going to see the uh desired slip uh 15 RPM slippage and here
is just uh is going in and out but then you're going to see after it warm the
the clutch warms up a little bit it just loses control and it shutters every
single this was shuttering every single time the Tor mot clutch would engage like right here is going into lock up
and this is a shutter right here and then it would kind of go down and and uh it would control a little
better and whenever it control a little better you see the the the pressure work with drop but then he loses control of
the clutch and then the same thing happens and this is just shuttering all over and this is actually a
shutter and whenever it releases like right here it's released let me go to
another one right here it's released right so there's no the green one is the pressure now right here where he's going
to go where he's going to engage is supposed to go down and be kind of flat right here is a shutter this is a
shutter and it feels terrible on the front wheeel drive because I mean the
mounts are different the the power Trin is set up different and uh you just feel
the whole vehicle shakes because it's a front wheeel drive and right here if we
go forward same thing here not as bad but here he kind of loses control a
little bit so this right here is a shutter and you can see the shutters like going in
this one right here was kind of all right right here you know it kind of
went in smooth but it lost a little bit of control and uh he wasn't after
third but then it got worse like we go over here and it just kind of and it
went in let's see let's keep on going
forward right here is very bad on some of them I mean you can feel
it like really really bad here's another one it just goes in and
it loses control it goes and sometimes he he would he would
uh he would stayed engaged right here he went in and I
guess we were in the highway here for a little bit cuz uh we're going to be in sixth gear for a little bit and you can
see the shutters coming out coming around off and it'll kind of flatten out
and then and then it will flatten out and uh this is a
typical glazed either they rerunning the the the uh friction material or there's
something going on I mean uh it's been very it's been very very uh bad you know
lately with this to converters aftermarket to converters some companies they do good work some companies they
also do good but then you get one or another that uh it get slipped through
the through the cracks or whatever and you end up getting one of those the problem is it's a front wheeel drive it
it's not a it's not an easy job you know to uh be pulling this out put in another
torque converter and then have the same issue and then pull it back out get another T converter and then put it back
in that's a lot of Labor just because one of the frictions got
reused or the wrong friction material was used
all right the one I showed you was an enclave this is a
Traverse right here you see 2016 Chevrolet Traverse check this one out
test drive one this is after this is one of the new tourque
converters I'm going to fast forward over here and you're going to see this is this is a this is a kicker right here
you're going to you're going to see what goes on sometimes now the thing is that here we
see he goes in very smooth all right so it's it's going in there very smooth and
then it starts cycling in and off on and off right here a little shutter and then it goes down and right
here this is a shutter right here I'm going to go forward that's
another shutter that's another shutter look at this right here so we're
we're flat we're kind of zero at 30 PBS and right here this is long
shutter on a front wheeel drive just imagine how that would feel on a front
wheeel drive keep on driving it's a small shutter right
here and then it just goes in and out right here you don't feel it on this one but you can see that the the computer
tries to compensate with pressure so right here this one feels like a crystal
crystallized Frenching material look at this right there that's the way it
sounds the way I'm doing it I mean we keep on going forward look at
this I mean this is this is bad this is bad right here and yeah sometimes you know like
well let's stop using that company and I mean you try to use another company and there's the same thing I mean they give
us another converter but I mean it's just too much work so you saw enclaves
Traverse I did ended ended up uh I ended up tuning these ones uh let's see right
here see I need need more PSI okay test drive five
final this one we opted not to pull it back out and
uh this is how it was afterwards you can see right here this is how it's supposed
to to go this is how they supposed to drive right here see this right
here RPM goes to zero and 38 lbs on the on the friction
lining 38 lbs to make it hold look at this nice and flat nice and
flat here we disengage cuz we are downshifting right here 6 5 4 3 and two
we did not make a please stop this is second gear right here it's
four 3 oh this is first gear yeah we came to
a complete stop there's no PSI the green is our PSI
this is just to following the engine RPM to converter clutch is not engag I'm
going to go forward a little bit and I guess that's when we got back
to the shop but this is after five re this is revision
five with with the HP tuners and we got this nice and straight and
good so yeah you can make a back converter work but sometimes after this
they do they do come back they do come back all right well let's go to a file and see what we can do about
these all right so there's a few ways you can do this thing uh so we here we have the uh TCC
Max allow pressure table so it's
138.236.128.7 now over here this this TCC desire pressure we have uh at the pressure control uh
amperage uh at pounds PCA pressure control a solenoid we have at 145 PSI we
have 123 lbs over here and on line pressure on the maximum is
232 D1 or 0.1 and here is wide open throughout
right here so 153 lb over here and 123 lb over here now here it's the uh TCC
apply pressure ramp now on this table right here uh it tries to add a little
bit of pressure to try to control it you can see it's 138 .2 lbs over here uh you
can actually copy this right here and just uh paste it right
here and uh this table right here you can put 123 lb from here you can copy
that and put it over here you paste it and uh let's interpolate right there
now let's go ahead and uh from zero all the way up and let's go ahead
and do that that's one thing you can do to this table and you're going to have the sa safe pressures here you're going
to start from zero all the way to 138 8.2 which is a 138.236.128.7
here uh you got a zero first this table right here uh you you have to uh zero it
out you don't want no slippage on first you don't want any slippage on uh on
second and you're going to turn those off you don't want to lock up in second or or third fourth fifth and sixth you
you actually have to zero all this make them all zero but on the shift pressures
right here you're going to change it to 290 lbs 290 right there 290 right
there 290 MAX Pressure here from D1
to6 also 290 now don't worry this is not going to
go all the way to 290 okay let's see 290 and
290 now this is this is just a m MAX Pressure right here if if I hover there it says maximum light pressure this is
the maximum desired line pressure allow this is a clamp for any shift table value and has the final say on the line
pressure offset before it is used on the force motor current table so this with
the force motor current Table we're going to go to back to that again now Max Pressure B it says line pressure
maximum value in some cases this value may be calibrated as actual line pressure after the regulator gain has
been applied we're going to talk about the regulator gain here a little bit the max
clutch pressure says clutch pressure maximum value in some cases this value may be calibrated as actual line
pressure after the regulator gate has been applied as well and then you have the maximum line pressure maximum line
pressure in each gear in relation to engine speed this is just the max pressure this is not the working
pressure just so that you understand that so we have a here the regulator gain uh the regulator gain uh
0.375 and the offset for the solonoid is 26.69
lbs just like you would see a fuel injector uh you have your your offet
this is where the solenoid is still off you're applying a uh current through the
windings of the injector by the time the the needle opens uh that's called the
offset from zero to needle open and this is the offset in PSI from 0 lb to
26.69 now you're going to have a little bit of pressure in in the uh in the Lower Side like right here uh
the table starts at 13 lbs the on some on some vehicles I had to modify this to
start at 16 lbs and then 16 pound goes up you know you can you can also do that
uh you can do 22 lbs I have to do some that really really really either the the
clearance in the to converter is not right it is not feeling right you know on the edges
uh and I have to modify this to 22 to 26 lbs on the first line here and then
interpolate upwards uh and you you see that on the
on some of the uh uh ad there let's go back to that let's go back to uh to a data
log okay here we go again every time I open up the scanner it does this thing
so let's go to Just test drive one and then we're going to talk about let me move my cursor over here so you can see
now right here it's at uh it's just a RPM slippage because there's no PSI uh
against the uh the friction now if I go here it's still zero pounds right and we
still see some slip now I'm going to click over here this is the offset right here and uh you're going to see the
pressure or the the uh the pressure right here so this is 16
lb this is the offset right here the offset is almost all the way over here so it's 21 lb so 16 lb is the offset of
the PSI before it starts to move so we have has 21 lb before it starts to
control the friction you see here 26 lb and on some on on some uh tables I have
to modify the minimum offset on the table itself not on the offset table and
uh I set it to a minimum 16 lb and uh up to 22 lb as you see here 21
lb he starts to control the slip and then it goes up 28 lb and you can see
the RPM starts to go down now let's go back to the to the
editor all right so the first table I mean the first uh column right
here we see this column we see the row
uh on this table here start at 13 lb 16
lb over here so this is the zero offset or the where it's set at offset so if
you bring this up to 6 lb you're going to bring this or you can copy this this row right here to the first row and then
interpolate and it'll bring it you know like let's say let's copy this one and paste it here and then uh interpolate
the whole the whole table like that you could do that you know you start at
16bs and uh the next step right here is 18.6 and 21 lb this is why I was saying
21 lb is kind of like where it already starts to affect the uh the uh the
Piston you know to clamp on that torque converter clutch 21 lbs and then you start controlling 75 lbs is
about uh where you have zero slippage even though you're under heavy throttle
you know 75 lb 80 lb I know I haven't seen a clutch go all the way to 80 lb 75
lbs I think or 76 lbs is the the max I've seen it go even though after tuning
so there we go I mean you can turn on the the apply and release you can just uh apply it in fifth and and sixth you
know the normal apply you put this uh at at
3008 uh 300 uh
318 it's not pasting there there we go 318 you can
make all that equal and you can copy this whole table you're turning it you're turning
it off pattern a you copy it there you paste pattern B you do the same thing
pattern B is already at 318 the release you do it at uh 3177
miles hour so this this actually turns everything
off from first to Fourth first to Fourth as you can see you're going to turn everything
off and on pattern B is already turned off and you can have it from fifth apply
fth apply you can do 45 miles an hour 45 miles an hour
equal uh let's copy this paste on the apply side apply in fifth you're going
to apply it in at 45 miles an hour and you can actually do that on on
on six as well 45 miles an hour and you don't want the the uh okay the release
you do it at 40 40 equal let's go ahead and copy this
row here and do the release at 40 here as well paste
that and the six if you see here the apply you can do it at 45 as
well that way it'll make it equal to the uh
to the other tables fifth and sixth are going to be exactly the same so this is going to become like an old school uh
old school uh lockup engagement let's do
40 this is 45 apply 45 equals and 40
here equals all right well I mean you can turn it all you f and six
only you're going to SA your clutch all these have to be turned to zero let's go
ahead and do all these right here because uh that way you can follow you
know first the explanations and then you can just follow follow along uh so we did the 290 the pressures
we're going to zero all this out because you don't want any to clutch lippage at all let's do
third fourth paste
F we're pasting the zero so it's becoming all
zeros and don't forget to put this on zero as
well because uh I did a test drive on one and I forgot this right here see how it says 60 and 45 over here on
DOD and I actually was seeing this command even though this was this will
override what's on these ones here all right so these are smaller tables Doods and we're going to turn those to zero as
well we go ahead and copy that paste it on the rest of them all right let's
paste it on now one so make sure that all are
zero I know this is uh becoming a little bit of longer video but I mean you know
me for my long videos so I mean that's it is what it is all right this one zero as well
otherwise you you will be commanding that uh 60 RPM slipage that 45 RPM slippage on that all right uh you don't
have to do anything on the adaptiv here you already modified these two tables you already saw that the maximum
pressure was 138 lbs uh regulator gain you don't move
this at all especially the regulator offset uh regulator offset is the way
the the uh uh regulator or the TCC solenoid uh regulator actually works
regulator gain just leave it at that uh I've seen it move to zero but it does
not it does nothing on some Vehicles he does on some
Vehicles he doesn't but I never do that I just do this right here apply
release Here Full Throttle you can leave it as it is or you can also do it as it
is here uh you can do you can do a lot of things I inan Performance Tuning I'll do
another video on Performance Tuning torch management leav everything enabled uh you don't want it to shift
hard I mean you want to shift that smooth so see as you can see everything's enabled on torque torque
management here torque reduction whenever you turn some of this stuff off it'll make
your uh it will not your time your timing and the direct injected Vehicles like this one this is a what a
14 is 17 uh when you have carbonized uh uh intake
valves uh they the time in in negative zero so normal it goes all the
way down to zero in between the shifts but yeah don't touch this unless
you're doing a performance tune and a decar um on your top end on the motor
all right guys well I mean this is just a short not not short but an
explanation on the issues with aftermarket to conver
clutches and uh the way we control them I use the sonx TCC regulator valve and
sometimes uh I I still use the uh transgo both boxes on the 6 l80s but the
6 l80s have been a headache for a long time for everybody and your converter
companies yeah I know one of you guys got pissed off at me and uh I mean
really got angry for because of those two short videos well now you see why I am actually pissed off at YouTube all
right well get your together just like I said on those two short videos
and uh just do what's right man do what right all right this is hm till the next
[Music]
one

You said:
today we're talking about the scanner
and I know I've done a video on this
already but I wanted to hit up a couple
of more in-depth expert level topics
specifically on setting up the scanner
and some of the special features so
stick around
[Music]
everybody welcome back to the garage and
I want to start off by thanking all the
new subscribers the floodgates are open
if you haven't hit the subscribe button
already hit it you don't want to miss
out on all this data it's coming fastest
coming hard is good information to have
especially if you're wanting to learn
how to tune your 1/2 bus you know brush
the cobwebs off and get better at tuning
the information is getting out there
people are using this and having great
results so don't miss out on it and
there's also some other cool stuff like
the super Auto which is a smoke monster
still right now but we've got a fix in
the works and so here in a couple days
that thing will be back out on the road
so stick around but for now we are
PID Selection
talking about the scanner I've got it
opened up here you should be able to see
the big things that we're looking at
right now is the PID list we touched on
this in the past I'll throw a link up in
the corner for the original scanner kind
of set up but I want to go a little bit
more in depth on the PID list we set
that PID list up before we do any
logging you know we connect to the
vehicle it gets the parameters that are
available for the vehicle to let us know
hey these are the parameters that you
can choose from to set up to log this
vehicle now you got a five years to go
out mad too many PIDs right now this
list probably has too many PIDs this is
a great list for going around and
checking the health of the vehicle but
when you're actually tuning specific
things you want to minimize the
different P IDs that you're using and
there's a reason before that so if you
think about the way that data is
transferred from the ECU through the the
HP tuners module or the efi live module
to the computer you have a message link
that is trying to cram all this data in
and it can do all this much data within
a certain time period well if each block
each PID takes up this much space and
you keep on adding once you exceed that
message length then you have to have two
messages so it takes twice as long to
transfer the data if you exceed that one
then it takes three times as long to
transfer the data so the idea behind
that is is the least amount of data that
we are transmitting from the vehicle to
the software they should have the
highest resolution data points we should
be updating the data as fast as possible
and if you load out your scanner PID
lists you will start to get slow data
and
that's not the best way to tune so if
you're tuning your math curve or
something like that get rid of most of
the pids that you use for speed density
tuning if you're doing speed density to
me we're not concerned about what the
map hertz is at that point time because
we're not you know doing any tuning that
surrounds us so a lot of that stuff you
know the torque parameters we don't need
to tune that whenever we're doing
fueling tuning you know we probably
don't necessarily need today it's good
to keep like timing in there across the
board whenever we're doing all this
other stuff so we can look for not
and stuff to make sure that we're
not getting knocked but spark advance we
don't really care about tuning spark
events or logging spark advance while
we're doing our fuel tuning so those are
just things to take into consideration
while you are setting up your PID list
so let's take a look at some of the
other features real quick now we've got
Math
open our window for our math parameters
and this is something great you've seen
me use these in the past to set up a of
our table stuff like that or to do
custom math you can do this stuff to do
horsepower calculations you can do it
for injector duty cycle all these
different things there's a lot of
formulas out here and this is where you
plug all of that in you know one of the
big things that you want to do is pay
attention to what your P IDs are and
what your decimals are and then whenever
we use these math parameters somewhere
else it is log to the the logical number
of the math parameters so we have 10
user maths and if you set something up
on user math 5 and then come back at a
later date and try to open up a table
that's using that it's looking at user
math 5 not necessarily what is in there
in this case it might be boost or EQ
ratio so if though if you move those
mass around on this user list it will
affect any of your graphs that you have
built out the other cool thing about it
is is with the math parameters we can
come down to the chart down at the
bottom and add math parameters in here
so if you right-click on that and to
open up your charts layout you can see
that this boost one is using math users
and it's basically manifold pressure
minus barometric to say that once we get
over barometric pressure we are in boost
but the cool thing about that is if
you're logging barometric pressure and
manifold pressure from the get-go from
the onset you can come back after the
fact plug this math in
your graph at the bottom and actually
see the results of that math on a log
that you've already done as I said we
are using those PID blocks we are
filling those PID blocks with log data
and then we are doing post processing
basically as a representation on the
histograms and the grass that we see
below okay let's talk about filtering
Filters
now that we've got some data loaded up
I've got a day log over in the corner
I'm not sure when it's from but I've got
my spark advance table in here and say I
only want to see what spark is being
advanced whenever I am not giving it any
throttle so what we would then do is
look at the accelerator pedal position
and apply a filter to that let's go
ahead and open up the graph settings on
this so we can do the filtering so now
you can see that we have this opened up
for spark advanced there's the filter
box over there what we want to do is add
a new variable and that new variable is
going to be our existing accelerator
pedal position that we have already been
logging and then what we want is we want
to say as you can see in the filtering
box we have accelerator pedal position
there we want to say whenever that is
less than say 1% so if we do a less than
1 we are now 1% because this is in
percentage and if we come back this is
all of our timing advanced on this table
that has been applied whenever the there
is no pedal input let's go back and look
at beforehand we can open this back up
take that out and there's our full spark
table now let's say well what if we want
to see how much advance that we had only
under full throttle
we'll add that PID back in but now we're
going to flip our direction now we want
to say accelerator over 90% well as you
can see there's only a couple spots that
are being hit where the the pedal is to
the metal in this situation that's just
kind of the basics of how we use
filtering this is a great thing that we
can do where we can go back and add
post-process filtering to specific
things to make sure that the values that
we're generating on our histograms are
within the means that we want so say
that we're out logging something and
find out that we maybe left our Oh two
sensors on where we were going into
closed loop you could go out and filter
out any of those cell hits that were
made while closed loop is active okay
now that we're connected up we got a
couple options up here you probably
already know about the Diagnostics where
you can read in and clear your dtcs on
there look at your readiness monitors to
make sure that you're good if you're
trying to clear emissions-free strings I
mean not really anything that we use
that often this just kind of grabs a
snapshot of all of your current
parameter readings in there so I don't
ever use free frames I'm sure there's a
reason to use it it's just not something
I've ever seen the need because once you
have the log or you have the ability to
do logs freeze frames are kind of an
antiquated way of quotient things but
the other thing we want to look at is
the vehicle controls and special
functions menu I'm sorry that we're
beeping here I know that's probably
driving a couple of you crazy but
there's nothing we can do about that as
long as we're recording this actually I
take that back let me try this so we got
the special controls or the controls and
special functions here and these are
some great things that you can do
there's a lot of stuff in here that you
don't necessarily need to mess with but
some of the things that we want to look
at is idle control I like to use that
every once in a while there is a
parameter in the log or in your actual
tuning file that you can max this thing
out and so he's normally set to like
1,100
pm's I think I've got mine bumped up to
1,500 and so every once in a while I'm
trying to get the vehicle up to warm I
might bump the idle up off the standard
eight or nine hundred rpms to 1,100 rpms
there are some special use cases for
that same ordeal with kind of throttle
position stuff like that
but some of the big ones that we like to
use are the fuel tab if you have
forgotten to disable closed loop on your
tune and you want to go ahead and pull
log you can disable closed loop right
here you can command it off and it
should hold throughout the time until
you do a power cycle on it the other one
that we want to do is the L TFT not
necessarily than learn we always want to
disable that whenever we are doing speed
density tuning or math tuning but the
reset whenever you get done doing speed
density tuning before you after you
flashing your new speed density tune
before you go out and start looking at
that data again you need to reset your
off l TFTs that's after you've put your
closed-loop system back in place and
you're using your oxygen sensors the
reasoning behind that is is that there
is a map out there that we don't have
access to that has fuel adjustment cells
on it that is based off of the switching
of your o2 sensors and if you go out and
do speed density tuning and then
re-enable closed-loop without resetting
this as soon as you go out and drive
your scaling is going to be off your
fueling is gonna be off and you're gonna
be like what the hell I just went
through this process of doing speed
density why are all these numbers wonky
again that's because you did not reset
the LT FTS through the scanner whenever
you do transmission changes transmission
tuning a lot of times you'll see people
say that you need to go out and do a
trans fast learn or a reset you've got
to be aware that there's some of these
that if you go in and we'll touch on
this later and some of the transmission
tuning if you go through it there is a
specific PID that you have to log that
will tell you to go through a shift
pattern and so if for some reason you
click on one of these and it's the wrong
one and your vehicle will not go
whenever it's in Drive don't freak out
the quickest way to solve it is to
redownload your tune and that will take
it back out of trans adapt reset so I've
been there before whenever I thought oh
man I've really broken something now
but that's something whenever you get
into trans tuning that you will have to
adjust your adapts or
reset your adapts because what it does
is your trans solenoid pressure whenever
we make adjustments to that is kind of
like the short-term and long-term
fueling it will try to bring those
things back in a line or it may make
corrections off of previous tuning that
you've done so we always want to reset
those after doing a trans tune the other
one is commanded gears once again there
is a parameter in the tune file that has
to be set up for this to properly
function so if you're going out there
and you're hitting the dyno and you want
to command fourth gear there's no real
way of holding it unless you go into the
tune set that up beforehand and then you
can come in here get it to fourth gear
and then hit command fourth gear and it
should stay in fourth gear throughout
the full pull and so that's about it for
the scanner you know we touched on the
basics of it this one touches on a
little bit more of the advanced features
in there that you can look out how it
does the data processing how we can do
post processing to existing data
existing tube files things like that so
if you have any questions feel free to
hit up the comments below if you're
looking for specific parameters our
custom user math let me know I can try
and help you out with some of that stuff
same ordeal with histograms if you've
got a specific histogram that you're
trying to create and for some reason
you're having issues let me know and
I'll help you know go through how to
create the histograms and I've done a
specific histogram video on the
different speed density histograms from
multiple platforms that should be
available in the tuning playlist which
there will be a link down below but say
if you haven't already subscribed sign
up let me know if there's something you
want to see keep your eyes peeled for
the next super auto video I've got a
scavenging pump coming in I think
tomorrow so the next couple days I'll be
working on that hopefully the next video
is us ripping some boost out there if
you haven't checked out the patreon page
hit that up there some special
behind-the-scenes features on there
that's only available to patrons and as
always thanks for stopping by the garage
now let's see if I can get out of here
without knocking my camera over
[Music]
you
You said:
please continue to save these notes you come up with.  another video:  hey guys if you're new around here my name is Tony Gagnon and I'm the North American Ford gas sales manager I'm
excited to be talking today about how to use vsem editor whether you're new to the software or just have some specific
questions about the editor stay tuned because we're going to walk you through all the basics of vcm editor and some
important features that'll come in handy when tuning thank you to everyone who submitted questions on social media make
sure you're following us online so you can also send us your questions for future videos so let's get started with
the most powerful tuning software out there let's get started today we're using this well-branded Volkswagen GTI
to do our vcm suite editor discussion if you haven't seen it already go ahead and watch our scanner one before you started
on the editor let's get started
okay let's go ahead and we'll start talking about the editor
all right we'll jump right in here we're going to go through some buttonology right off the bat on the editor we'll start off with the actual top buttons
VCM Editor Buttonology
and go across that's a little explanation of each one of these on the file we have open file if you
want to open a file obviously that's an open file you know this right next to it there's squeaky Keys we call them quickie Keys like control zero if you
hit Ctrl zero boom that open it up and you can open up file from there all right close just so it says you hit
close it's going to close the file save all right so whenever you modify a
Saving (as) a file
file you save it I'd recommend save as and you save as one two three four or
mod one two three four inadvertently because we're human you may mess up on four you have to go back to three so
just save as it'll be a follow-on file again there's a quickie key with the save as well export if you have export
permissions you would have that on your laptop as well recent files shows all the files you've been involved in as you can see there's
a ton of them here on this one exit would actually shut the software down so you go to a blank screen
Edit - Tune Details
okay edit so calibration detail is very important and you select calibration details it's
going to give you the information from that computer
right there you see there we have the actual creation data of it which will be today the vent of the vehicle it's a
2015 Volkswagen Golf GTI two liter Force owner the controller is associated with
it it shows you what the controllers for the actual ECM and the TCM so you have
both of those on there if you want to add a controller you could do a controller and add in for
like a body control module whatever so if you're going to read another one or bring it in okay
Edit - Remote Tuning
remote tuning so remote tuning if you're actually remote tuning a vehicle you can set up as you have the master controller
the person on the end with at the remote shop would be the slave and you can set up permissions for entire rights
calibration right or restock restore stock calibration all those are there easy to set up you can set your
restrictions on it and then the Master Slave you can set for the actual interface number okay super simple on
that view change history log anything that's changed is going to show up in there so
Edit - Tune History
you can actually open and text new editor you can actually go here and put it as a compare file and then you can
put a different collapse that you want to bring it to a tree format or or the other a different style looking at it
if you modify files say we change the temperature here change this to 50 when
you change that if I bring up the history log it'll actually show me that's actually been changed right there
so it gives you an idea of what's actually been changed so you can go back and see it okay
Edit - User-Defined Parameters
user-defined parameters if you have a parameter that you've done and a
different software that you want to import there's instructions now that do it on our website and we also have we're
going to do a video on that here in the future as well um to purchase a licensed vehicle you have to go in at your login page and
actually select that template applicator
Edit- Template Applicator
um to me this is one of the best things we have in HP tuners to do stuff this goes along with our template editor
which we're going to talk about here shortly which we actually bring in the file we can take the modified parameters
we can import those in save it as a value file if you want to call it that and then we can actually put it on a
file that come in Give an example let's say we have another 15 GTI command and we had all the tune done for this car
with all the parameters correct we could actually build that as a template and then grab that template and put it right
to the new vin and we'd be operational in less than 30 seconds so instead of 30
minutes three seconds is a lot quicker
Edit - Parameter Navigator
Navigator control n this is your best friend when you're new to the software
when you hit control end you'll come up here and type it you want to want to see if you want to see spark you type in spark it brings up the parameters right
there they need to have spark associated with it so control n is your function for that it makes it easy to find things
super super easy for you to manipulate if you're looking for any spark tables
or you hear something or you write on internet you need to check out a you know torque table you can type that in it will show up there using the control
end function and view so view you always want to use Advanced uh basic is just basic format
Edit - Basic vs. Advanced View
from the vehicle Advanced has all the parameters I can't think of a reason that you'd want to use basic you want to
have every parameter that you want access to so always be in advanced mode but you always want to check that and
make sure you are in advanced mode compare so compare a file uh open
Compare Function
compare file if we open up another GTI they had a modification to it so in this case I have a modification to the the
counter threshold so if I open up a compare file which the only one here is a GTI read
this actually would give me in a comparison log what's been changed it would show me the counter threshold it
would show me the any other things that's been changed in the DTC list that we've changed there okay so that's one way to look at the
compare the other way we can actually select the other file from right here so we have the show main thread main file
and we have the show compare file so that's what we're looking at in the file we're looking at the vehicle this would
be the compare file and you know this that is back to a hundred if you hit the right button show
differences and we'll go over this again we can actually Clank this to a zero when I do that boom it brings it right
over super easy to do okay that's our compare file works
so closing a pair of five if you closing compare file we close where the one we're looking at you close it now it goes back to just the primary file
notice you also lose your compare functions when that's gone recent files recent files in your
compare you can go through another file that you have before in this case I could go back to GTI read it will open up that file using your
your actual compare recent files all right makes it easy to find another
file you've compared with and bring it up show main file is what we're looking at now if you actually show compare file
it's going to bring up the previous file and it would show differences in this case we already change the difference so
it's not showing up comparison log shows us there's been a
change here we can double click on this and in this case it's not going to show us in the compare mode one thing about
that when you're looking in your engine Diagnostics and dtcs you go to compare it will not show the differences however
we squared and highlighted when you go down through them
Segment Swapper
and segment swapper in this case we're not dealing with a GM vehicle so we're not dealing with a segment swapper but
if we were using a GM vehicle we need to swap for a 6080 transmission back and
forth from that we could actually go into the segment swapper grab that file and bring it in and I believe we're actually going to make a video on this
in the future I'm using segment swapper as well so look forward to that
How to read and write a vehicle
flash Ctrl R would read it Ctrl W writes it in this case we've already read it so
you know this is only the right vehicle is there if we were going to write the vehicle we hit Ctrl W or we can just click this button here or we can click
this button here multiple points for you to write the vehicle from
that's the flash button the tool button all right so unit conversions unit conversions we got everything here from
Tools - Unit Conversion
putting in the tire size let's say we have a 325 uh 50
15. type that in there it gives us the tire height so we can plug that in when
we're doing our tire gear Tire wizard it also has Fahrenheit to Celsius speed from mile an hour to kilometer things
that we would normally see for changes it also has injector calculation data so if we had a 42 pound injector which was
at 43 PSI and I put a same injector but I went to 58 PSI it would show me the
difference in that so super nice to have these unit conversions in the software
Tools - Calculator
for us calculator is pretty self-explanatory
gives you a calculator you can you know 75 times do hey we goes on 50 just a
calculator to do your calculations in now one thing about using a calculator and I can do this I want to show you this here so if you're actually using an
airflow number let's say this number here if you click this and by the way the easy way to use this software is try
to highlight this when you're doing stuff see how I just move the cursor on into a highlight there it's easier if
you just I'll show you this if I just click on the name it highlights it for you A lot of people are trying to do it
the hard way this is an easy way to use the system when you highlight that so I'm going to use a control C and I'm
going to go to my tools and my calculator and then all I gotta do is Ctrl V I can
take that number and say times two that gives me the number just highlight that I go back to my
number here I just highlight it Ctrl V that puts it in there okay
Tools - Language and Measurement System Options
okay in options we just recently opened up and we're we're growing every day and putting more languages in there I could
tell you the number today but it'll be different tomorrow because we're adding more and more languages so for right now if you want to change it you would
select the language and change it to it in this case I'm gonna leave it on English because I'm not bilingual and I'll speak any other languages at the
moment so I'm just going to leave it at that
next would be template editor this goes back to our original thing about template editor now
Template Editor
we're going to be doing a video on template editor and applicator so that we have a good defined thing on it for
right now just know that this is where we grab our information that we've changed and save it so we can add it to
other files to make it easier to change the tune so time is money money is time when you're tuning a vehicle so it makes
it easier and quickly for you to do it also if you have a tuner and your tuner wants to send you a template to get your
car started they can send you the template you load the template onto there and you're operational with your file ready to go with a template so it's
a great tool to have specifically for tuners and end users
Window Options
window so Cascade we can put these in different and so in other words if you want to look at the software and
different things you put at Cascade so every time you open something it puts it in a different format uh if you want to
top vertical you can see that where that changes across the screen I personally like the Cascade function where it just comes down so I open up something it
comes in and it shows it so experiment with what you like and what you like to see and then you can use whatever
there's no rule on that you can tell it horizontal and go from there so close
all would you close that would actually close them as you notice that so I'm going to reopen that again to engine you
can see this is back up all right the next thing is
uh this little button right here tells you what you have open so if I close them all you'll notice I go back to the window it doesn't show it so if I open
up engine and I open up exhaust if I come up to the window it shows me engine and where
I'm at okay so I'm using the engine series
all right if I'm doing engine Diagnostics it'll say what window opening be engine Diagnostics as well
Help Menu
right The Help menu obviously it's exactly what it is it's for help so you can go
to help menu you can actually open up and what this is it'll take you to the actual instructions from vcm editor all
the questions normally asked how to get started this is a great tutorial to go into and look at this is being updated
every single day now so we're getting more and more data in there making it easy so if you have questions definitely
use our help meeting to go through and look at it there's a ton of information in here that can help you so I would
recommend reading through the help menu at that point the next on The Help menu is the license
License Information
information so if you have your device plugged in your device hit device information it would show you any of the
devices that you've actually licensed on your computer you can see I have several on here and it will show you what
specific controllers for that computer has been used at that point this one right here is new the mpvi 3 we're using
right now and there's no credits or anything associated with it so it doesn't show up so if you have multiple cables you've plugged in it will show
all the information from those cables the next one's resync interface very
Resync Interface
important whenever you plug the device in if you've switched between cables between a private label RTD or an mpvi 3
or an mpvi2 always reseek the interface and what that'll do is actually communicates with internet you can see
this it's going to go on there it'll see if anything is available if there's any updates need to be done I'll show up as
well resync completed you're done now your laptop is now tied into that unit
VCM Suite Information (info log)
the assignment information is very important there's two spaces to get that either the little blue eye here or this
this is important because one of the things you can do when you first plug into the vehicle and you want to get the data from it you can hit right here the
little button right here it's going to populate it's going to show you anything associated with it's going to show you the credits associated with the device
how many used how many have been purchased at the bottom if there was any codes it would show it in this case
um I did not have the key on so I'm going to do this right now so you can see it again with the key on
so I'm going to populate now with the key on and it shows me information it shows me
the ECM and the Tsum information if there's any diagnostic codes that would show up here as well okay
so super easy it's a good thing to have when you're sending a support ticket in they're going to request an info log
plugged into the vehicle so they get information from the vehicle and they may ask for a debug file as well so
that's the vcm suite information application keys if you use an mpvi1
MPVI Application Keys
your application key would be in here this is where you enter it in if you updated your credits you have to copy and paste this in here kind of tedious
actually we're spoiled now because mpvi 3 is out and all we have to do is just hit resync interface and it puts the
credits on their force that we purchased so if you have an mpvi2 and you want to
MPVI2 Verification Code
purchase credits from someone other than HP tuners so you would need this information need a serial number and you
also need the verification code for them to enter it into the system all right so that's where you get that
verification code for them to put it in their system to apply your credits
Parameter Access (Advanced Parameter training)
the next one this is the parameter access once you complete your Advanced Training then you have access to certain
parameters and this will give you the device code for it and you can link the device to it at that point super easy
we're actually going to make a video about this here in the future and describe it in depth
About - Updating VCM Editor
and about about if there was an update that needed to be done we would have an
update here in this case this is updated yesterday there's no update and found so we don't have to update it tells us V
submitter version 5.0.2 is what we're using right now for our testing so that shows you what you're in for urecm
all right now we're jumped into editor editor is where we allow to do the
Building your tune
modifications to the tune so we can write it back to the vehicle it's very very powerful remember you're always one
keystroke away from disaster so always remember that little tidbit information so when you're going through here you're
changing things this is where it's all done this is where the magic happens to tune the vehicle okay in that vcm Suite
Credit & Licensing
information if you notice right here the credits purchased credits used credits are how we write the vehicle
licenses you have to have the credits it may be two four it may be one credit uh certain Vehicles maybe even more in this
case the credit assigned to license it would come off of this number so if I wrote with this one which was two
credits it would show me a 48 and it would show me a two that were used there so that's how we use our credit based
system we do have a video out there it's very well detailed go ahead and take a look at that video and explain to credit
system for HP tuners so the next thing underneath those section up here we have these buttons here same thing just a
Buttonology part 2
little quicker to get to places like if you want to open a file you click on that one allows you to open a file
we have the next one let me actually I'm going to open up the file again
the next one right here if you want to save the file save file you would click on that it would save the file click on
that save the file super simple this right here is a folder you want to close the file you hit that it closes the file
the next one is calibration details if you click on that right there it's going to give you those details again with the ECM calibration information the TCM
calibration information that's ready right there as well remote tuning we talked a little about
that if you're going to use remote tuning system you can use this button to get you there quicker
if you change history log shows current unsaved as well as saved files and you can actually save those as well so
that's a button to go to open compare file like I said if you want to open another comparify click on
that it'll ask you what compared file you want to go to and you can open that file
again these are little quick quick places to get to if we add a compare file open which I'm going to go ahead
and do I'm going to open a compare file so you can actually see once it's open if there's a difference here that would
be the compare file and that would be the difference between the two
now we have unit conversions again so it's just the fahrenheit tire size injector size same thing within our
little tools up there except it's a little button we can go directly to people ask why do we have in multiple places because when someone's doing
something and may not want to go to a drop down menu it's it's quicker to get to this button to bring it up I call
them quick keys to get me there faster okay if we want to read the vehicle this
would be available in order to have that we'd have to have no file open obviously the right to vehicle there's a
button to write the vehicle do that or we can hit Ctrl w ow and here's our vcm suite info button
to bring up the information from the vcm and the vehicle so now we're going to talk about the lower toolbar
Tool bar - Favorites
so favorites okay so what you can do with favorites let's say you have a favorite that you're doing a master
transfer function you can save those in there so every time you open up a file the master transfer function will come
up as your favorite that may be something that you're doing multiple cars or multiple utvs say you want to
change the torque Management on them you could sit in as your favorite and every time you click on it it'll take you right there every time so if you've got
three vehicles in a row and you want to do them all for torque management you can bring that up boom boom boom instead of cycling through again time is money
Tool bar - OS
money is time when you're tuning a car so the next one would be an OS in this case um
in the GM world we have multiple operating systems and in the Ford world we have certain operating systems that
we have updated for like trans brake and stuff like that and later on the Mustangs we also in UTV world we have
operating system updates to allow us to get better data logging so always check your OS button to see if there's any os's available that may need to be
upgraded that you may be used to for better data logging change to a trans brake or upgrade to a two or three bar
map sensor in the GM world engine takes us right to that thing
Engine Controls
we're looking at our engine data an engine we have General so this is kind of an overview but to
give an example it's going to give us our engine size it's going to give it different data what kind of pump it has engine coolant temp stuff the next one
is Idle obviously idle self-explanatory is what the auto RPMs are set to
and underneath that one there's a torque one for idle as well and the torque winner is Idle reserve for torque most
of the engines now are torque based so they're going to use some type of torque based control of the idle so that's why
we have the torques listed there airflow several here with a general we're talking about you know the inlet
pressures things like that in this case this is a GTI so we got to be density tables coming into play here and our
electronic throttle controls for wide open throttle versus you know part throttle throttle limits if we want to
set it to 50 percent throttle opening we can do that in here charged motion plates if it has charged
motion plates it'll be listed where you can do the opening closing or look at the flag when it's opening and closing
variable cam obviously if it has variable cam this is the adjustment Point you're going to go to change the
variable cam positions lots of information here again your one keystroke from disaster so study up on
variable cam before you start changing things pressure control this comes in where how
much boost you're going to make gives you adjustments to change how much boost you're targeting what the pressure is
what the wastegate differences things and that in your pressure control and obviously in turbocharger we have
Max speeds uh whether it's equipped or not the blow-off valve the wastegate controls are all inside the turbocharger
stuff here and again each vehicle is going to have its own uh different tables that it's going to use to control
certain things obviously you know on a GM Camaro you're not going to have a Turbocharger set up in there to control
wastegate it's just not in there but at a GTI it is and your Ford EcoBoost the same way
exhaust you have a catalyst protection stuff in here as well as you know the
temperatures for it's going to reach a certain point where it actually comes in and adds fuel on the Catalyst okay so that's your Catalyst controls in your
exhaust feel important when obviously we have General we have your stoic fuel ratio
you have whether you're rich or lean you have your controls for your fuel pumps here
oxygen sensors there's minimum Lambda and a minimum Lander alternate on the GTI uh in a Ford GM and Chrysler World
you're going to have your Ford and aft O2 sensor controls as well plus your open and closed loop stuff which is on
the next page on this one so open and close loop it's going to show you the fueling and opening it's going to be your base fuel tables things
like that that's all in your fuel tables power enrichment when you go to wide
open throttle power Richmond is coming into play it gives your target Lambda wide open throttle
that's where it's going to be found in your power enrichment tables and the temperature controls we have the
Catalyst controls if the temperature reaches a certain point it will need to add more fuel if that's the case this is
where the targets would be and this is genetic component protection we could change this number and if it's in Lambda so if you understand Lambda you
understand where to put it cutoffs you got your rev limiter and neutral as in you know where the steps
when you put it to the floor in neutral or your maxed RPM if you're wide open throttle on the vehicle that's only going to turn in this case it's set at
8160 and there's other controls in here come into it you also have your verbal controls things like that and that's
over here as well lean fuel saving in this vehicle is not a big deal
however in the GM world you have your active fuel management system as we call Dod that would be listed in here you
would have your controls here for that in the mobile world we have the MDS and we'd go in there and actually disable
that or enable that from this point as well and our lean fuel saving Flex Fuel if the vehicle is a flexible
vehicle these are where the controls would be for it so we have them defined you know if it's an F-150 with flex fuel
if it's a late model Camaro or late model truck that has Flex Fuel it'll
show up in here that's where the controls are all right spark okay this is where Spark Advance
is the tables for the knock your MBT your borderline spark your minimum spark
between shifts all that's going to follow in your spark tables along with spark we have functions with the
knock sensors how much is going to be these are the controls to control that in
dwell if you have certain coils and you've modified the coils and you want to put more dwell into the coils this is
where you would actually change this if you change the quality requires a different dwell setting this is where you would find these controls
and the knock scissors themselves the threshold for the knock sensor the gains from the knock sensor these are where the controls are in the knock sensor
tables the next will be torque model torque model again these engines are torque
based so in a certain thing it may need torque at this throttle position it this will be a different torque these are
where the modifications would be for your torque settings monitoring in the system being a torque
monitoring in a Ford you have monitor controls if it exceeds those controls and it will put it in limp mode or
called failure mode in this case I don't see anything here so this vehicle and monitorings has only one selection on it
torque management okay that's part of our fast stuff we've talked about before in previous videos so when the torque
management is very important you can modify the torque management of the vehicle and pick up a half a second in like a Dodge Challenger just by
modifying the torque management without touching anything else in the tune so torque management is very important study and understand how the torque
management is affecting this vehicle and this is where the modifications would be done you notice in there has a driver demand
and the torque management the pedal is requesting the torque the PCM is requesting the torque of the engine the
fuel appropriately with it so this is where the torque controls are done in the driver demand tables
and again if I had a Turbocharger which this one does there are controls here for the turbocharger affecting that
Engine Diagnostics
driver demand torque and now we're into the engine Diagnostics in the general table Diagnostics mean where the
controls are for like the math things like that and diagnostic controls so here with this GTI we've got certain
ones here with similar conditions RPM limits diagnostic text for voltage tests
are there these are where those things would be at whether you're setting a Max mass airflow voltage in a in a Ford or a
GM it's all going to be in these General tables and engine Diagnostics airflow obviously the airflow if it's got
throttle leakage it's got a different you know a vacuum leak something like that this is where you go into airflow and you set the different tables to
check certain things again it's an engine Diagnostics misfire so this if you have a big thumpy
Cam and a vehicle it's going to pick up a misfire this is where you would dampen that misfire data in this case with the
GTI it's got a duration counter so after so many misfires if it had a bad plug it's going to kick on the check engine
light and tell you what cylinder has the misfire this is what the misfire data comes from so DTC mini is going to have
all your codes whether it's an SAE or an actual specific vehicle code so whether
it's an intake sensor code as you can see all the way down to the O2 sensor codes now you'll notice over here we
have some graying out these will actually be available once the advanced parameters testing is completed you'll
Transmission Controls
have access to these transmission all right this is the transmission controls everything from your controls we're
going to talk about real cop I'm going to go through them in the general menu we have our RPM limits over there shaft
speed output shaft speeds these are where it's going to be found in our general in shift General it's going to
actually have the controls for shifting of the transmission the firmness the pressures things of that nature
shift scheduling just like it says where you want the transmission to shift at one to two two to three this is where
this information is going to be now this one has some sub menus to show you it has a normal drive mode it has an
economy mode has a sport mode and a manual mode each one of those are listed so you can modify according to that
which makes it really nice to be able to control for how you want to drive the car in what mode
shift pressure is the next thing your general shift pressures whether you want the transmission pressure to be firmer
or softer you can bring and modify here and then you have your adaptives adapters meaning that it's got you drive
the car it's going to learn how you drive the car and that's where the adapter menu comes in and you can modify the Adaptive periods as well to learn
shift timing okay so if you want the transmission shift firmer then you would Quicken up the timing on it these allow
you to controls in normal mode and you have a economy of sport and a manual as you can see here and an upshift the same
thing it has an up shift for your controls for the shift timing and you also have the downshift controls for
your shift timing so you may want it firmer on the downshift that you're road racing the car you want to make it softer if you're just driving around
these are where you make your your adjustments
torque management for the transmission again a major control thing here to be able to modify the torque management so
you can enable or disable certain things in here to make it firmer softer however you want again study up on how you want
to adjust these but you have it for your up shift as well as your downshift again how you want to drive the car or how
your customer wants to drive the car these are where you make these adjustments at
Transmission Diagnostics
transmission Diagnostics if there's dry transmission diagnostic data in here the
things that you can change it will be listed in the diagnostic tables there's not much here on this GTI obviously but
you know if the line pressure is too high whatever else you can move the pressures this transmission Diagnostics
is where it would fall for that data and the transmission diagnostic data on some Vehicles you'll have DTC menu as well
and you can access those
Fuel System
fuel system so fuel system we have the fuel pressure obviously what pressure is
supposed to be set at we can change the setting from PSI to bar to you know all
the way up to kPa we can change those that's what those little settings on the side little tidbit information there when you're doing them so with the fuel
pump for the control we can say how much duty cycle it has on some of the vehicles we can change this number to
pump the gas out of the gas tank we can use that for that so it makes it nice fuel pump control module it actually
desired pressure for the module this is where your control for most your vehicles have a non return system are
going to have a fuel pump driver module this is the weather controls would be fuel tank some of the vehicles you have you may want to change a gas tank in say
you're doing an F-350 and you want to put a 60 gallon tank from the 34 gallon tank you can actually do that and you
actually have access and some of them to change that setting so your your gauge will be correct but this is where it
Fan System
would be set at here in your fuel tank gauge settings fan system will be the next one obviously we don't have any fan system controls in the this GTI but this
is where we would actually set the fans to come on earlier or later depending on what we're doing with the vehicle last
Speedometer (speed limiter)
but not least Speedo so speed limiter it's a big one on that this is where the limiter's at so if you got your 16 year
old is going to go drive the car you can put the speed limit or 60 mile an hour or if you want to drive it you could put it at 155. so obviously this is where
the speedometer limited controls are going to be in this also in Speedo and other vehicles you may have your
calibration data here as well where you actually set the calibration for the tire size as well most of the newer
vehicles are actually using the body control module which is controlled through the scanner to do your speedometer calibrations
How to just read the ECM
so one of the questions we have is that when we go to read a vehicle there's multiple modules on there what if I just
want to read the ECM and I don't want to read the TCM well I'm going to show you how to do that right now so first I'm
going to be the read vehicle function I'll Gathering the info it's going to come and tell me it's a GTI
you notice that there's two modules there okay so read entire and we also have the TCM if I just want to read the
engine on this all I got to do is go do not read and read and it'll just read
How to adjust fueling depending on IAT
so the next one of the questions we had is that how do we adjust our fueling depending on IIT well today in this GTI
we actually have an IIT threshold temperature that we can select with a Target Lambda so in this case the target
Lambda if it's 140 degrees is going to go to 1.0 all right so if we made this you
know 160 over that and we'd want to go personally I would actually fatten it up if it goes over that but this is where
you would actually go to Target Lambda based on IAT one of the questions we also had was about how to adjust our
How to adjust fueling at idle
fueling at idle what we're commanding for idle in this case I've brought up an actual s197 and I brought up the fuel
base versus RPM versus TPS what's the throttle position sensor you'll notice at 1.0 Lambda we're commanding at the
point or throttle position of 14.6 or idle at that point as we step into the throttle as we go into it it goes into
the commanded Lambda of 0.86 so if you wanted to change this for some reason to 1.1 or 0.97 you could do that now these
are affected by a couple of things one of the things is on a cold start it's actually going to be a little different
so your fuel base right here is this and then cold starts a little different on it so
all right cold start may be actually a little richer or a little leaner but normally you want to make your adjustments on your actual run which is
over 170 degrees so on the question of adjusting the idle fueling it's targeting whether the fuel
base is in this case a starting 1-0 Lambda so 10 Lambda on this vehicle would actually be stoic of 14.08 so if
you're looking at your fuel trims or your air fuel wideband it'd be targeting 1408 trying to get the percentages right
so if you wanted to change that you could come in here say you want a little leaner you could say okay this point
between you know I'm an idling here I wanted a 0.98 I could put that in there and that's what it would actually Target
so it's a pretty straightforward way at Target targeting the Lambda for your
How to add spark
idle fuel so the question was asked how do we add spark in a spark table in this
case this is an SRT4 and a wide open throttle spark table on the left hand side we have map pressure in kPa and
obviously this is a boosted application and across the top we have the RPMs if we know for a fact that you know in this
area we wanted to add one or two degrees it would be simple as adding one or two degrees now what I recommend you do is to take a look at the graph first look
at it okay see how it's not really doesn't have big spikes sticking up and everything else so you don't want to go in here and you know put in here like
34. because you go to look at it there's your Spike sticking up right there okay so I don't recommend doing that
so if you're looking at it and it needs that you want to add a little spark to it to see if it picks up then by all
means you could actually go in there and look at it when you data log it look for knock very important make sure you have to a knock but let's say in this area
right here at 3 300 up at 210 kPa it wanted you wanted to add another two
degrees put two degrees in there save it right into the vehicle make a pull if there's no knock and it looks good
adjust according just remember when the farther you go on the timing the closer you get to pre-ignition or detonation so
Torque Management tuning
be very careful on that so one of the questions we ask is hey do I need to buy a system to make my pedal more
responsive and I say no you can do it through the tune and this is where we do it we're going to use our torque Management in this case where it's a
2015 Mustang and we went to our torque management driver demand and now we have our pedal characteristics now I'm going
to show you what this looks like in normal mode you see right here this has been modified
where the pedal here from zero to 100 percent and as you step on the pedal up here about at this point at 22 percent
pedal we're 26 throttle now from the factory these would be matched 17.9 you
see the bottoms mashed it would match all the way up 100 100 so it's a one to one ratio in sport mode which we like to use sport
Mode's more aggressive and you can see at 38 petal we're basically at 50 percent throttle opening so the pedals
when you're stepping on the pedal the throttle is actually happening faster so it has more throttle response in this case this is
where the driver demand comes in to make those adjustments now just a little note if you have an 18 up vehicle and you do
this your skip shift will not drive correctly it will feel weird to you so just so you know make adjustments
according to that as well okay so we someone asked about copying a
Copying files from one vehicle to another
file from from one vehicle to the other or copying files from a vehicle to another vehicle Give an example so we
have a 15 Mustang we have a stock file and then we have a file that's modified so the file that's stock is the one
we're working on and we want to put a file onto it so if we have a file that's modified previously from a same style
vehicle then we can use that data really simple process in this case I'm going to open it up I'll go ahead and open up a
stock file and I'm going to use the compare function to bring up the other file
so now I have a file that has modifications done to it and now I can tell if I open up spark or a few
whatever you see the difference the green tells me that there's something different about this now the best part
to me the easiest way is to look at a comparison log this gives me everything that's different from that vehicle so
being at the same year it's an automatic and everything else there one thing I could do if I just want to
copy over everything at one time is I could just go up here and right click and copy over all the differences now I
don't necessarily recommend that and one reason why is because between a 15 to 16 and 17 years there's a little different
oil pressure sensors and if you change that and you crank up the car and it says no oil pressure your customer is
probably going to lose his mind because they have no oil pressure in this case I don't recommend doing all of them at one time so you can actually go into select
the differences you can pick this one right here say I want to change over my my imrc controls you copy that over if I
want to do my fuel enrichment I could copy that over all you do is right click on it
copy over selected differences and it moves it over if you want to move all the files like I said you go up to engine you can right click copy over all
differences and guess what you just moved everything over and again you're taking a chance that some things might
be slightly different in there so I highly recommend pick and choose you want so one of the questions we have is
How to disable PATS
about Pats the passive anti-theft system how to disable it if you have an s197
car pretty much any Ford from 99 up that we support you can go in and disable the
path system let's uh go in there and show you exactly how to do that it's pretty simple I've got a 10 Mustang here
I open up a system format right over here you see Pat switch all we got to do at this point is disable that save the
file write it to the vehicle pretty straightforward simple on disabling the Pats on one of those on a coyote
platform with our software you cannot disable the PAT system okay so that has
to be sent off to someone else to be disabled our software does show a switch for it but it is not enabled in our
software at the moment if it's a Camaro and you're dealing with a late model Camaro or Cadillac or Corvette there's
multiple functions you have to do on that and we're going to make a video on that in the future to show you exactly how to do that
I hope you found this video useful in learning how to use vsim editor and about some of its key features if you're
ready to start tuning your vehicle make sure you watch our credit and license video that's linked below to get started

You said:
welcome back to the garage everybody we
are back in the office actually today
but I wanted to take a moment to go
ahead and get back to the basics here
look at the scanner let's touch on a
couple things these are kinds of tips
and tricks that helped me out so I
figured they might help some of you guys
out if you find any of these helpful
make sure and hit that thumbs up button
down there if you already knew all these
do me a favor hit up the comments down
below and share your favorite tips or
tricks and that way we can kind of get
some more information out there like how
people are using the scanner once again
if you have not subscribed hit the
subscribe button down there hit ring the
bell you don't want to miss out on any
other live stuff and excuse me if I kind
of stagger and stumble around here this
is the like third time I've recorded
this because I had some recording issues
earlier as usual it wouldn't be the
garage if we did not have recording
issues that being said thank you to all
the new subscribers we're about to break
what five thousand let's just say five
thousand we're about to break five
thousand thanks to all the new patrons
got a lot of new patrons love you guys
you're the greatest and yeah let's just
jump into it let's you know as they say
let's hit up the tune screen we as I
said are diving into the scanner this
thing is very powerful if you know how
to use it right but there's a lot of
things that people don't know about it
that we can kind of get into that might
help you out whenever you're going
through the tuning process and it all
starts with the channel list well I'd
say I take that back it actually all
starts with the layout you see this is
my preferred layout you notice I don't
run graphs or gauges on here but the
cool thing about it is is you can save
your layout and then just kind of flop
between them so you can go into the
basic ones which are just like base
they're based on what the o2 is set up
whether it is going to be long term fuel
trims AFR or lambda and then whether or
not you're doing the manifold air
pressure our grams
four cylinder and if you click that it
changes everything brings it out it's a
little bit scrunched up because the
windows small over here on the toon
screen
I always forget this like looking in a
mirror but as I said if you have
different layouts that you like to use
whenever you - like some people do the
nice thing about it is you can save that
now keep that in mind that your
parameter list and your math and things
like that don't always carry over
parameter list might but I know math
does not so if you save a layout and you
have done math on it and then you go to
a different layout it may or may not
carry over with you that being said I'm
gonna jump back over to my tuning line
out get rid of those gauges don't really
care about those and let's dive into the
parameters the parameters are you've
heard people call them registers or P
IDs which are parameter identifiers z'
well there's a couple things to keep in
mind one of them is is you'll notice
that there's different little arrows
here the ones that have an arrow is
pointing both way or what are considered
a polling parameter and the ones with an
arrow pointing one way are called a
broadcast parameter well what's the
difference between those that comes down
to whenever we are running with
bandwidth we have a set amount of
bandwidth if you come down into the
details down here it will tell you on
your vehicle info which I'm not hooked
up or I don't have a tune in here what
the bandwidth is normally on a can it's
around 500 kilobits per second that
means you can only fit so much data per
message in there and a lot of times on
the June 3 stuff before the can bus came
out you will have parameters disappear
that's because you've got too much
information polling but one way around
that is by using broadcast parameters
where they're available and the quickest
way to find out where a broadcast
parameter is available is if you go into
add a channel while you're adding these
channels filling out your channel list
if you go in here they will have this
green box behind them that means it's a
broadcast parameter you can also
unselect this and it will only show you
broadcast parameters well broadcast
parameters are being sent out by the ECM
to the network to all the devices that
communicate on the network like your
gauged cluster or your BCM all that
stuff so that data doesn't take up any
of that communication overhead it's
already on
we're just bringing it in all these
other ones though those require
communication overhead so if we want to
look at engine coolant tim sae we have
to pull the parameter from the ECM and
get that back now that's where we get
into the other half of it sae Society of
automobile engineers used to mean that
main means something else
nowadays it may just be sae these are
standardized parameters in which they
are the same the address is the same
everything is the same between any
platforms that supports the obd ii
protocol that's a good thing and it's a
bad thing
in particular it is a bad thing in
situations like accelerator pedal oh did
you guys know that this text filter up
here will actually search for stuff so
if we go pedal boom-boom-boom okay
accelerator pedal position if you were
to click on one of these and it prompted
you to use the generic one I've already
got that one wrong let me try it it's
not gonna let me it's all right what is
going to often do is put you on the sae
this SAE one though this is where you
see things like the accelerator goes
from 20 to 75 percent that's because
that is looking at a voltage and it is
transcribing that voltage into a
percentage that does not necessarily
match what the ECM looks at from that
zero to a hundred percent so you want to
use the non sae in those situations now
the rest of them is probably not an
issue in particular if you were using
something like rpm say they actually did
not have a rpm we type in rpm up here if
they did not have an RPM that was a
broadcast one and you had to choose
between regular and SAE their spokes
both gonna do the same they're both
going to be an angular frequency it
doesn't matter in that situation you can
use the generic one and not have any
issues but on things like your throttle
body and accelerator robot a throttle
position this one will give you that
weird number whereas the other ones
should give you one that is more
relative to zero to a hundred percent
keep that in mind whenever you're
populating your list
now that we have that out of the way
that's kind of the back end but the
other things that we can do is we can do
transforms in fact I have a transform on
my wideband because if you were to look
at the EQ ratio that comes directly out
of the 30 - 0 3 10 a lot of times it is
one decimal point off based on how many
decimals you're showing on your gauge if
you have it set up for two like I do
instead of three decimal points it
actually only brings in two decimal
points in here and so whenever it is
supposed to read one it reads 10 you can
use a transform for this and here you go
in choose your parameter which in this
case it would be under oxygen sensors
equivalence ratio and it's right here
whenever you then select it you can
apply math to it this is also how you
can apply scaling math if you need to or
if you want to transform it if you have
it coming in as lambda and for some
reason you want it to read as gasoline
you can scale it to gasoline that place
some of the other cool things that you
can do with parameters is let's go ahead
and open up a tune file here we will
look at a recent one is you'll notice
that everything has a unit on it and a
lot of these are Imperial if you go into
tools and you set up your options you
have the options between Imperial metric
and native and most of us are going to
use an imperial because that's what
we're used to but once the data's in
there it doesn't care what the unit is
so you can actually come in here at this
point time and change the units at any
time so say you're trying to follow
along with somebody else that tunes
manifold absolute pressure and inches of
mercury for some reason you can still
read inches of mercury the data is going
to be correct same ordeal on I don't
know let's see here fuel pressure if you
want to see what your fuel rail pressure
is in bar we can do that we've come over
here grab bar boom we're at 96 bar
that's cool it's nice it's helpful and
at the same time even if it's reading in
bar here doesn't mean that it changes
over on our graph so that being said
let's take a real quick look at the math
you've seen me going to the math in the
past that's something that we really use
a lot whenever we do our graphs the cool
thing is a lot of this stuff is
predefined you'll
I have a lot of math here the big one
that I have to use is pressure ratio gin
fives rely on pressure ratio for your
virtual volumetric table as opposed to
map pressure and this was just
straight-up simple manifold absolute
pressure divided by barometric pressure
now a lot of these other ones like boost
they already exist so make sure and
double check your predefined list hey
there's the same thing it's doing the
same thing so double check your
predefined list for things that already
exist you'll notice this one's in kPa
mine is in psi but you can change that
same ordeal with AFR and EQ ratio error
and if you have to do some additional
math you can go ahead and copy these
over and then paste them down below in
one of these to do user math now there
is one catch whenever you're doing
something like this if you put the user
math in a specific spot in the graph is
mapped to that specific spot you have to
keep that math in that specific spot or
you will break the graph and that's what
I mean is if you were to save this
parameter and then later you're loading
it up and you put it in eleven that
graph is still looking for the same math
in spot two also if you're in here in
the math parameters and one of these has
a pink box earch appears red that just
means that the parameter is not in your
list over here you'll see that a lot on
the wideband specifically the serial
ones that sometimes they get out of kind
of out of whack and you have to reboot
your computer with the USB adapter
plugged in because it will disappear
whenever you start logging if you were
to go in and look at the math at that
point time there would be a highlighted
red PID in that group now the other cool
thing about it is to see this number
right here this is the extension this is
the unit's if you were to go in here and
hit edit variable and we change this
from lambda to AFR this is going to
change this back number now this first
number is the actual PID itself this one
relates to the EQ ratio generic sensor
PID and then this is the units you can
view all of those underneath tools if
you come up in here go into quantities
and units and here they are so say you
were looking at pressures here is the
extension after the decimal that you're
going to see for all the different units
of pressure
just kind of useless but neat to know
moving on let's take a look at the
graphs the first thing that may stand
out to you that a lot of people don't
know is there some of these that have
red around them well that is an
indication that there's filtering being
done to this graph so if we come into
the grass layout and we select one of
these spark advance you can see there's
a function on that and it has a cell hit
filter spark there's no function
but there still if cell hit filter so it
is showing up with that red box around
it and the thing about it is is it gives
you something to take a glance at and
say oh hey I've got something that is
affecting the data I may not be getting
the whole picture so it's just kind of a
quick baked heads-up you may not be
getting the whole picture cool thing
about this is though just like
everything else you can save these
graphs you can you know transfer them
from one laptop to the other you can
have default setups you can move them
around these things are very flexible
and you've seen me get into a lot of the
graph stuff and I've got some specific
videos on doing advanced math and graph
stuff so I'm not going to get into it
then the last but not least kind of
thing I'm not going to touch on the
gauges because I don't use them they're
pretty self-explanatory and the chart
versus time really is also if we come in
here and look at our charts layout we're
basically just giving ourselves an
accurate representation of the data that
we are logging in the parameter list as
a visual representation and it's a good
way to scrub through and find data in
fact I was using this particular log
earlier to find points where driver
demand was getting maxed out and so
being able to see the peaks on the RPM
has been really helpful in situations
like that so make sure and use this
whenever you're trying to troubleshoot
an issue now you come in here change the
different couples a couple different
things around so if we come in here
let's change this over to spark Wow
spark spark spark spark spark spark
spark
actual spark advance we've got limits in
there boom let's look at it you got to
scrub this well that one's not working
for us you have to scrub it around often
to get that filled in so spark advance
sensor there we go
45 is a max0 we're in degrees we should
be good there now if we scrub this in it
should fill in
okay 24 45 now you notice our details
down here are still based off of rpm
just a heads up we're still going to be
off of rpm if you're not logging rpm in
these situations so that's basically it
pretty straightforward nothing too crazy
but as I said there's a lot of stuff out
there that people don't realize that
they've never messed with and hopefully
this sheds a little light on some of the
things that you can do with the scanner
makes you understand a little better of
why we try to limit oh you know what
that reminds me one thing let's jump
over I forgot to bring this up whenever
we were talking about channels you can
come in here I've got to close this one
out you can come in here and actually
change the polling speed now on some of
these things we want a high polling
speed but if you're working on an
earlier generation where you're starting
to run out or you're giving these empty
boxes whenever you start pulling some of
these you can adjust the polling speed
now as I said there's no reason to do it
on the broadcast one because that data
is already being there it's not taking
up overhead but like this one right here
which is kind of redundant in this
situation we can come in here and look
at what the polling interval this one's
at a one-second polling interval I could
bring this one out to 10 seconds because
that's not changing that often same
ordeal with maybe air calc mode is that
a one-second interval I can bring that
out to a two-second interval it's not
going to mess with anything but where it
can be a very helpful is if I go into EQ
ratio commanded it's in 20 milliseconds
I've already bumped that up I can make
that pull even faster I can make that
pull every 10 milliseconds and that's
whenever we have the ability to up the
rate of specific things that we're
tuning so if I were to come in here and
do say that afternoon or something like
that I can clear up a lot of these
parameters that I don't care about and
then I can ramp up the rate specifically
on the ones that are related to the maps
such as the mass airflow and then the
mass airflow sensor which is the one
that reads in Hertz that's really
important so this one's at five Hertz
I'm gonna bump that up I'm gonna make
that you know ten times faster so I get
a higher resolution data out of my data
logs once again things like engine rpm
I'm probably not quite as worried about
that one so I can back that one down if
I need to if I don't need to though I
leave what words that you know these are
things that you can play around with you
get high-resolution data get more data
in on your log if you start getting
those blank cells saying that you've
maxed out that data of communications
windows and just kind of ways of giving
yourself a little more overhead in those
situations so that being said hopefully
as I said you guys have learned
something new if you haven't make sure
and hit up the comments below and tell
me your favorite tips and tricks about
the scanner because there's a lot of
them that I've don't touch on there's a
lot of my problem you don't even know I
learn new things every single day it is
completely possible so let's share that
knowledge share that information if you
have any questions about the stuff that
I just touched on make sure and hit up

video helpful hit the like button as
always subscribe check out the links
down in the comments or in the
description for the merch for the the
decals for the patreon all that fun
stuff you know the drill got to go
through there I got to say it but as
always abt always be tuning and I want
to say thank you for stopping by the
garage I gotta set this transition thing
up I don't know what happened to all my
transitions you know here let's try this
is it going to transition no no see you
guys
[Music]

You said:
what is going on youtube so this is a
different change of pace for me um i've
never really done a screen recording of
a windows application before that's not
a video game
so uh bear with me
uh basically what this video is going to
be about
is getting the 6l90 transmissions to
auto shift or up shift automatically
into the next gear when the car is put
into manual mode and basically um the
factory settings on those cars allow
users to use either the gear shifter or
the paddle shifters on the steering
wheel to manually downshift or up shift
but in this case we're just going to
focus on downshifting only into a
preferred gear so let's say you're on
the interstate in sixth gear cruising um
somebody lines up beside you you want to
do a 40 mile per hour roll race
you can put it in manual mode and
downshift all the way to second gear
but what's going to happen in the
factory tune you're going to be stuck in
that second gear so as soon as you floor
it the car is going to go through up the
rpms and hit redline and bounce off the
rev limiter until you physically
hit the up shift button on either the
paddle shifter or the gear selector
itself
so um there's a huge delay so if you're
eyeballing attack and it's starting to
climb up there to the red line and then
you
input it usually the delay is so
significant that the car will bounce off
the rev limiter anyway and uh pretty
much just kind of hang in that gear for
a split second before it commands the
next shift so that can screw you out of
a race
and it's just really bad on the car to
bounce off rev limiter so what we're
going to do is avoid that entirely so
what we're going to do is have the car
manually shift second gear the way we
want it to
but this time
at red line
instead of having to
put any user input yourself the car is
going to automatically shift into the
next gear
so uh
i'm going to show you guys how to do
that this is my table that i'm currently
using on my specific car right now
and uh before i go into detail about
this table right here i'm gonna show you
guys
exactly how your file is gonna look as
soon as you upload it from your car onto
hp tuners
so over here on the left
the tab i'm moving now
is
let's just pretend this is a fresh
tune that you pulled out of your car
it's the original tune that came off my
car before i modified it myself
anyways
once you get the tune uploaded we're
dealing specifically with the trans only
so it's this tab up top up here it's
highlighted in blue now
and then uh once you get the trans table
or the trans menu pulled up you want to
go to your shift scheduling tables and
these tables that we're going to work
with are
in this left
column right here
and we're just dealing with part
throttle shifts right now so
Normal Shift Table
here's our normal shift points which
would use this as a template when we
start to adjust the tap up and tap down
tables which is basically the manual
mode
um
so i'm gonna close this out and i'm
gonna open up
the normal tap up tap down table here as
you can see here's a
compare comparison between
the uh original factory tune and my tune
and the transmissions and as you can see
here first the second second to third
and 34 shifts command the next shift at
313 miles per hour which is physically
impossible
so
that is why the car will stay locked
into that gear
so basically over here
on my table in the left here you can see
that i have the second or third shifts
command at 53 miles per hour at 87
percent throttle position which means 80
percent throttle position is almost wide
open throttle it's the pedal almost put
to the floor um that is my personal
preference i want it set at 87
but let's say that
you don't want that you want
it to command that shift at 100 which is
pedal to the middle wide open throttle
so that way there's no variation between
how far i have the pedal down that's
just completely maxed out then you would
adjust
these uh
values
to 100 percent throw position
so basically
what i'm gonna do is show you how to
copy my table that i have over there on
the right and again it's all preference
so i'm gonna have this table right here
command at 87 percent throttle position
which means again almost 90 percent of
full throttle the car is going to
command the next shift
so what we're going to do
is we're going to look at our 87 to 100
values right here
Throttle Shift Table
in the normal part throttle shift table
so 87 to 100
these lime green bars right here want to
select these well we don't even really
need to select them but the uh the mile
per hour target is 29 miles per hour for
the commanded shift so we're just going
to go here
and we're going to put in those values
29 miles per hour
so now basically that's mimicking how
the car would normally shift from first
to second
so that way now it's going to command
that shift whenever the throttle
position is 87 percent and at least 29
miles per hour
so
it's basically that easy so when i close
this out when i go back to normal we're
going to look at our second to third
shift
at 87 which is 58 across the board here
so we're going to go back to normal
here's our second to third
and i want to put that value
58.
and
now we're done with the uh second to
third want to go back to normal and look
at our third or fourth and those values
are 93.
so we'll go back to our type up tap down
and we'll adjust those values
and again like i said if you uh
want yours at a hundred
percent throttle position then you would
leave these
87 94 boxes
alone you leave them at 313 or if you
want to command the shift earlier at
like 75 percent then you just go back
and correlate
the 75 values
with the tap up and tap down values
Part Throttle Shift Table
it's actually really really easy it's
not that complicated and the cool thing
about hp tuners is once you modify a
table it's going to highlight it so now
we're done with their normal tables
now we're going to look at our part
throttle shift and fifth
so these this is our uh fourth to fifth
shift
and
126 is the value here
so i'm going to open this
put 126
right here
okay that's done
sixth
uh the values are a little bit different
between each mile per hour here
or throw position so
we have 154 which we can just leave it
at 154 we don't have to put the other
values
so we can just start off here
154
and just put that throughout because the
ship's going to command 154 miles per
hour but
at this rate the race will probably be
over with you shouldn't
shouldn't be shifting from my fifth to
six anyway
uh
but just in case
uh those values are just uh
consistent throughout
so uh
again if you open up this table
it's gonna look like mine over here all
except how i want my first gear to
remain locked in first gear for burnouts
and stuff
um
because i do not want the car
prematurely shifting from first to
second when i'm doing a burnout say at a
drag strip or something so again if you
want to do that yourself
uh just go back to your table
and put in 313 as the total value all
the way across
and to make it a sure fire thing the car
will not shift into second gear
you can go to your full throttle shift
rpms
and you can adjust rpm to something the
car physically can't hit like 9000 rpms
so say
you definitely don't want first gear to
shift in the second you can set your
rpms 9000 because the car was never
going to hit that and the car was never
going to hit
313 miles per hour so
basically
that's what you do there if you want to
lock first gear for burnouts and then
have your other gears follow a suit into
auto up shifting for you
so yeah basically um
i've done a lot of research
and uh
trans tuning is like 600 bucks and i
thought that was outrageous just to have
somebody
get in here and do what i just done
and i figured i'd show you guys how to
do it yourself that way you can save 600
bucks and it kind of gives you that you
know cool do-it-yourself feel but like
hey you know i've
tuned the transmission myself even
though you really didn't get that in
depth with it but there's a really cool
tool called a blue cat trans tool
it's a calculator that you can uh
use for your car's uh horsepower rating
and you can adjust it makes tables for
you it pre-calculates everything so like
all these uh tables right here it does
every single one of them throttle full
throttle and full throttle shift rpm and
speeds
uh it'll make those for you and you just
copy and paste them definitely check
that out uh
let's see and another guy really helped
me out was a horsepower factory
his video he pretty much showed
show me the steps
you know
of how to do everything and you can see
i have all these tabs up here um let's
see this tab right here
on the ctsp forum
this guy basically
describes exactly what i just done
um
you know there's no videos on youtube
about this so i figured i'd go ahead and
knock it out
but what this guy's doing he had his set
the the shift at 25
and i guess he didn't like it so he
bumped his all the way up to 75 or 69.
anyway um the way i have mine set works
perfect for my application
uh like i said first gear will stay in
first gear but if i'm in second gear and
like at 40 miles per hour and i raise
somebody in for it
i don't have to worry about anything my
car is going to automatically up shift
into third gear and then third gear to
fourth
so
basically that's what that is so you can
cut out the stupid tap tap which means
like if you're going to roll race you
select a gear then
as soon as you floor you shift back into
touring
and then you shift back into sport mode
which is just
it's a headache and sometimes it's not
efficient either
but uh
i wanted to avoid all that i just want
to be able to select my gear floor and
just
focus on the road basically
so yeah anyways um
just totally improvised but uh i hope
that i got the basics out there for you
and i hope this video can help you guys
out and save you some money and i mean
it's perfectly safe it's not like
we disable torque management you're not
going to go outside and blow your
transmission up i can promise you that
all you're doing is just activating auto
up shift and manual mode
uh so yeah um everything gets on here
you don't touch
just the tables i showed you
and the shift scheduling tab the only
one you really open up
and that's it so yeah thanks for
watching

You said:
so who's been on Tik Tok and seen this
video right
[Music]
here or what about this one right
[Music]
here so that truck's my buddy Taylor
King's truck and that's one of the
thousands of Gen 5 trucks that I've
tuned now his is a little bit better to
burnout than a lot of them that one is a
Whipple rods Pistons camed 62 stock ad90
though but lt4 fuel system E85 I mean
the truck's pretty Rowdy but you guys
have been asking about me doing a Gen 5
burnout video and I've kind of held
tight on this information because this
stuff is just really not out there but I
think it's time so let's go ahead and
want to jump in this
video we're going to start off with a
2015 Chevy Silverado 536l 85 feel like
this is the most common foul that we're
going to come run across or at least the
most common that I run across this is
going to match up pretty much an eager
68 trucks the 90 trucks will be a little
bit different on driver demand stuff but
for the most part they're all going to
be the same so just like our Gen 4 video
we're going to jump straight into brake
torque management so for that we're
going to go to engine we're going to go
to torque management we're going to go
to General and we've got brake torque
management right here so just like the
other ones this disabled by TCS is
enabled which means that if you disable
traction control the traction control
button is going to disable the brake
torque management but there is a catch
there is a limit so this limit right
here now these numbers may look high but
this is actually axle torque so right
now we've got an axle torque limit of
2788 foot lbs we can go ahead on Max
this out or basically come close to
maxing it out so we can just type in
96671 so
96671 foot PBS of torque it equals we'll
close that out the next one's going to
be your multiplier for vehicle speed so
I've had a lot of guys where they would
do go to do burnouts and say they get up
in a second or third gear and the truck
would just kind of lay over that's in
this multi right here so you'll see this
is accelerator pedal position versus
vehicle speed so we can just take this
and because it's a multiplier we can
just make it one so the next one that
we're going to do is port management
right here normally I wouldn't Max these
out but for whatever reason GM actually
maxed these out in the Corvettes so
we'll just go ahead on and follow suit
and do what they do so we can just type
in
96671 and I'm just going to take and I'm
going to copy and I'm going to tab down
and paste and we're just going to roll
all the way through like all the way
down all right
so a lot of you guys especially the new
guys they see this page and they think
okay I'm going to go through here and
I'm going Max everything out so their
next step that would go to is they would
go to this peak torque table do not
touch this like you don't ever really
need to touch this like I've got some
big power vehicles that I mean sometimes
you got to increase this lightly but you
only want to increase Peak torque I I'll
show you what it is so this is
essentially a torque limiter with this
53 truck it's not going to make anywhere
near this torque so we're completely
fine so the next one is going to be your
driver demand table now this is a big
one so what we're going to talk about is
we're going to talk about map a b and c
so map a if you notice this axi up here
this is actually in kilm per hour no
matter what your units are this is kilm
per hour and inside of this graph is
actually kilowatts so if you notice at
zero how much less kilowatts the truck
is asking for versus at 10 km/ hour 20
kmph 30 km hour so what I have found
that in the newer trucks like 17 18
model trucks GM actually did increase
this so what I like to do is I like to
copy the higher parts of the table from
a 2018 so let's go to compare open
compare just go to my documents I'm just
going to search
2018 silver
a my L button on my keyboard is not
working good I'm in my new studio and
I've got a nice Corsair keyboard but
apparently when I was messing around
with it somehow I messed up the L button
and you can't just buy an L button
anyway so we're going to go to compare
and if you notice right here in the blue
all the areas in the blue is where the
18 model is higher so we can just go to
all our blue stuff just enter zero and
we can do this all the way
across all right so now that everything
that was blue is now zeroed we can
actually close out this comparison file
and we can actually open our comparison
file and make our comparison file the
same file that we're modifying so if you
notice how it says 2015 Silverado 536
stock as our compare file also so what
we want to do is we're going to click
show differences and if you notice this
is how much we've increased our driver
demand table so what we can do is we can
copy this and we can go to our map B we
can highlight it all and click add and
we can go down to sport toe
Eco highlight all and click add so so
now our driver demand table is much more
burnout friendly now you guys can shape
this table as you wish based of the way
I modified it it's a it's an OE style
table so we don't have to worry about
reduce engine power and we're going to
have good throttle response while
maintaining good drivability I don't
really recommend on a stock truck I
don't really recommend modifying it any
more so than what I just showed you the
next one we're going to do is this one's
a table that a lot of guys don't
understand so what we're doing is we're
looking under torque request r limits so
one thing to note on Gen 5 stuff anytime
you see the word immediate immediate is
timing based because timing is the
easiest and fastest thing to remove or
add torque if you see predicted
predicted is throttle body it's air flow
so what we're going to do is is under
increasing right here you'll see
predicted normal and you will see that
in these gears there's actually a this
is basically a torque Delta so what we
can do is if we want our throttle to be
super responsive we can just max this
out just like what the factory did in
the other
gears and in some in some operating
systems this is actually maxed out like
not in the trucks but in some operating
systems it is so we do that under
predicted normal and under predicted tap
shift and what predicted tap is it's the
tap shift it's your when you're in the
mode where you're using your touchup
touchdown on your shifter that's this
that's what this is controlling all
right so the last thing we're going need
to do under our driver demand table is
in 2014 trucks especially some 2015s
you'll see this torque shaping and it
will actually should be enabled from the
factory just disable it basically what
torque shaping is basic like a learn
feature for how you drive there is no
reason for these trucks to learn like
our accelerator inputs because if we
want to drive like Grandpa's for you
know 5 days out of the week and then two
days out of the week we want to go do
burnouts we don't need the truck
learning that habit you know so we'll
just make sure this is disabled and
again it's primarily 2014 silver Auto
and some of the 2015 like the GMC Denali
with the 6 l80s just it's it's only in
some of them um but just make sure this
is always disabled so now that we have
our driver demand table set up so we've
done taking care of torque management
we're taking care of driver demand now
we want to work on power enrichment so
power enrichment is pretty simple on
these go to fuel you're going to go a
power enrich and then the first thing
we're going to do is they have an enable
torque so we can click this and you'll
see that basically what this table is
telling us is that the vehicle has to be
at producing at least 60% of its Max
available torque to go ahead on and
bring in power enrichment you can leave
it like this if you would like I
personally zero this out I like a TPS
based power enrichment I always have
even in in the Gen 3 Vehicles so it's
the same with this uh minimum torque
hysteresis so this just go ahead un zero
it out so then I go to the throttle and
enable pedal um and just like I showed
you guys in gen 3 and Gen 4 videos I'll
go ahead on and go over like 3,000 I'll
type in 60 and then right beside I'll do
50 40 and then I'll just go 30
so that takes care of TPS based power
enrichment the next one this one's kind
of a topic that some guys are for it
some guys are against it I don't know if
you guys are aware but direct injected
Vehicles whenever you rich up the
vehicle you can actually cause like a
fuel knock so there's this knock
enrichment table right here and this
table is only active in certain vehicles
I have never found an application where
knock enrichment being active at
actually solved knock I've seen this
actually cause knock so what I always do
is I will go to this enable ECT and I
was type in 493 because on a lot of the
Corvettes uh lt4 cars stuff like that
that's exactly what their settings is so
again I try to duplicate factory
settings anytime I possibly can but
realistically that's going to be it for
as far as doing burnouts goes now I've
already got out my Gen 5 608 video so if
you take what I just showed you guys and
you match it up with the setting that I
used in the 6l80 video you've got a
pretty much optimized stock tune to
where you can still run 87 octane you
still tow you still do all that stuff
but then you can also do burnouts and if
your motor mount's good and you're on
good fuel you can also have max power
available so anyways guys thanks for the
likes thanks for the comments thanks for
the subscriptions I'll see you guys
tomorrow

hey guys David here with dbr high
performance we're at Speed Shop just
south of Nashville we are here at the
Power Tour 2024 with HP tuners we've got
a 85 C10 with an LS in it we're going to
show you guys something that we've seen
a lot this week some torque converter
settings let's get into it all right
Torque Converter Settings
guys so what we've been seeing the most
of this week is people coming in with a
stutter going down the road and most of
what we found has been in the torque
converter settings they're actually fill
in the torque converter slipping back
and forth so I'm going to show you guys
how to fix
that so if you go here we've got vcm
editor open go to
trans go to torque
converter to start you got maximum and
minimum this is how much it applies the
clutch so
maximum set it to
99 close that out go into minimum and
this is the one you can play with this
is stock settings here a lot of the
aftermarket converters they like if you
set it at 75 so instead of it slipping
the clutch
it pretty much applies the clutch really
fast some converters they like it if you
set it at 90 some 98 this is something
you can play with this can really clean
up the the application of the torque
converter
clutch the next is going into the apply
release these are the different speeds
going into normal and this is a factory
torque converter lockup schedule for a
Tahoe if you go in and select the whole
table and add say four miles an hour
start there and see what feels good in
the truck that's a great place to start
adding four so you go add
four add four now in third gear it's
going to apply at 36 versus the factory
which was 32 fourth gear 44 it's a great
place to start making those small
changes can really make the vehicle feel
much much better so now that we've made
our settings for our torque converter
we're going to go in and we're going to
save file save
as and we're going to save that file
as
TQ settings one that's going to be our
first that's going to be our first try
it's always good to save every file you
do so if you don't like what you have
you can always go back so at this point
Conclusion
everything's ready let's plug our mpvi 3
into the vehicle and go from
there now that we're plugged in and
connected the vehicle we're going to go
ahead and write that
file all right guys we just showed you
how to go in and change your converter
lockup settings uh this can fix a lot of
issues with drivability this week
especially we've seen a lot of people
because of the type of driving we're
doing when the converter would lock up
it would shutter this has fixed all of
the vehicles and it's very easy to do as
you guys can see in BCM editor it's two
tables that you change minimum maximum
torque converter um play with those
you'll have really good results once
again guys David with dbr high
performance located just south of
Nashville we specialize in late model
Himi LS platform and coyote platforms if
you guys are interested in working with
us check us out at dbrh high
performance.com and we' like to hear
from you soon

I'm Matt with Matt's Transmission here today to  demonstrate JASPER's TCC programming package that  
they continue. So on the 6L80 6L90 one problem,  and the main issue, is torque converter apply,  
and how it works. So what this is going to do  actually is JASPER has set this up to where  
it's going to eliminate the TCC apply in the  early gears - in second, third, and fourth.  
So it's going to apply it just in fifth and  sixth. So what that's going to do is reduce  
the wear on the torque converter, and also the  load on that. You get a different load apply  
in second than you do in fifth. So that's  going to really help out that converter,  
the longevity of it, make it drive a lot better.  All right, so first thing you want to do download  
the TDN app on your smartphone; really easy to do,  simple. Next thing you want to do is make sure on  
your vehicle that it has the latest part number  or software for that vehicle. You don't want an  
old part number, so after that you want to plug  everything up and read all the information out of  
that vehicle before you take that transmission  out. What you're wanting to do is get all the  
calibration, everything, all the software out of  that vehicle and put it on this device. For this,  
plug your RTD device into the OBD port;  wait for the green light to come on.
There you go. Okay, so here's your TDN app.  What you're going to want to do number one is  
set up an account. Real easy and simple just like  you always do if you've downloaded apps before,  
it's no big deal. Then you're going  to want to go into the account,  
go to invite code, and then install your code.  Okay, so before you pull the transmission out  
you need to read the vehicle. Go  to the flash button on the bottom,  
please plug in the RTD device, turn the ignition  on, hit OK, and you will read the vehicle. Now  
this will take care of all the information that  you need before you pull the transmission out.  
Okay guys, on a little tip on these push button GM  units to keep the key on while you are doing this  
procedure, you have to hold the button down keep  it pressed down until the dash displays lights.
There you go.  
That'll stay on as long as until you want  to push that button off. Just a little tip.  
Okay, so what you want to do is just read the  vehicle, and pull out all the information.  
Okay, so this is what it's going to look like  after you read the vehicle to the app. Okay,  
so once you have the transmission out, and  actually you install your new transmission,  
you've got everything buttoned up, one thing I  want to make a key point is make sure you have a  
battery maintenance charger, or a charger hooked  to the vehicle. The key will be on for several  
several minutes. Okay, so once you get the  transmission in, you have your RTD hooked up to  
Bluetooth, you're going to go to the bottom of the  screen here, press the flash button, or flash tab,  
select the vehicle that you're working on, and  then you're going to go down to sync files. Once  
you sync that up it's gonna just start reading  the files, and go from there. Okay, so once it  
brings you to this screen you're going to select  the TCC, or actually it says 2014+ 6L80E TCC  
template which is on the bottom there. Once you  select that you're going to select Write Vehicle.
Follow the prompts,  
and there you go. So once you see this screen  you're pretty much done. What you're going to  
do just hit OK, and you are ready to unplug your  RTD device, and start the vehicle. All right guys,  
so once you get to that last screen, you've  hit OK, unplug the device, turn the key off.  
Once you get done just give this to the customer.  This is theirs. This has all their information on  
it. Keep it in the vehicle, whether you want to  hand it to them straight, or just put it in the  
glove box, however they want to do. But this is  their device to keep. Guys, not only do I choose  
JASPER for my everyday vehicles that I have in  the shop, but they also can do a lot of research  
for issues and problems on a lot of products, and  come up with a solution for guys like me and you.
You said:
All right, maybe I'm the only mechanic
or tech out there that just struggle
buses along
with programming, but you know, the more
I do it, the better I get and the less
frustrating or maybe I guess I know who
to call when I have a problem. So, we're
dealing with GM, obviously. This is a
2020 very nice
Tahoe 53 6L80. I am using Snap-on's um
stable power. This will do 30 amps. If I
was dealing with a bigger uh power load
for programming, I have a stable 60 amp
charger, but for what I'm doing here,
I've had very good luck. You can see
it's very stable voltage. When it does
have a demand, it has an audible, you
know, fan that comes on to kind of keep
things cool. I'm programming with a Dell
laptop. This thing has been really good.
I think it was about $1,000. I think I
bought it at Staples. But what I ran
into today was I could
not when you would boot Techline Connect
and you would try to connect to the car,
it would immediately shut down Techline
Connect. Now, their customer service is
excellent. They said, "Hey, Snap-on
knows there's something going on here."
And so, when I called them, the tech
support was great. He said, "Hey, look,
I'm not trying to pass the buck. This is
a Snap-On issue. Now, something that
nobody has ever explained or I've never
had anybody answer, and maybe it's
obvious here, but we have three
different icons. You have a power icon,
you have communication with the car, and
then you have power from the car, and
then you have a Bluetooth or USB, I
guess. When the USB is not connected,
the far right one in your screen will be
red. when you're connected to the car or
the computer, one or the other, those
two terminals will be red. And when and
if you're able to program the vehicle,
which is this one here, I assume you can
see it's flashing. It will flash. So,
what I had was most of what I needed
except that vehicle
flashing. Now, I can't show you right
this second. I will make a separate
video on that. Bottom line, you have to
go into the toolbox. I don't want to
disrupt it now. As you can see, we're
getting pretty close to being done here.
Um, we've probably been fighting this
for maybe two or three hours at this
point. So, anybody that tells you
programming is easy, well, give them my
number because I'd gladly hire them. So,
um, we we've overcome this at this
point. We're now learning the new module
that's internal in the transmission or
the TCM to the vehicle. We now have the
communication with the vehicle. I could
do a code check through the toolbox and
it that part of it works. So, that kind
of threw me off. You have to update it
and and look for a different video. I'll
put that out here shortly.

You said:
hey everybody we're back today we have a
2017 53 Tahoe we did a uh BTR stage one
Truck cam not too long ago on this one
and it was on 87 at the time we tuned it
on 87 and we did the headers and all
that good stuff too with it and um she
came back with 93 in the tank and we
added E85 put the sensor in there Chris
tuned it and we got some really good
Gams these LT the direct injection stuff
picks up more than what we usually say
is our
2% on na stuff so she also added a Corsa
yeah cat back and she requested a little
bit more chop so we got that taken care
of as well we we will get an idol
video this is
today's
93 and
E55 approximately yeah and this was this
was the final on both so yeah this is
after the 93 tune the 87 tune it made 39
19 or 20 so it did pick up quite a bit
especially after 5,000 on 93 and could
be from the exhaust you know making it
more efficient too for sure and U but
yeah it it definitely picked up quite a
bit on the 85 which is what we typically
see and like I said the the direct
injection stuff really likes it you know
probably for several reasons for the
cooling effect right in the cylinder and
because it's taking up more space you
know in the chamber um because it takes
more fuel one thing to note is the low
side fuel pressure on on this it has
a uh 10% or 5% it has a little more fuel
l on the high side it's not a 32 like
most cuz it's a stage one cam it's not
made to make huge huge power um but to
you know something of note of course is
the low side was losing on this even so
we had to add a little bit
more fuel on the E85 side the normal
because of the droing fuel pressure
there's the DSX setup is that the whole
DSX setup yeah okay y oh and another
note is this was done in thir gear on
the 35s right yeah this truck has like a
308 gear in it I believe with big tires
so we want to we're not trying to run
the truck you know yeah it' go third
gear was going 114 to 15 I think that's
plenty fast um so yeah overall it did
good April got some videos this time
she's hanging out
today probably needs something if she's
here
what well I kind of
do of
course so yeah overall very happy yeah
we did do the standard it's 349 for
anybody wondering on the 85 which is
always 2% and uh we will get the Chop
video at the end and the dino videos
from April and I will also put the grass
up as I always do and this thing needs
gear yeah I think the gear will be the
next step if you put a gear in about 373
maybe even a 410 yeah I don't think they
use it to go out of town much I think
they have another truck they go out of
town this is just a Town Car how much
bigger these are 2 in more I think so
about 2 in so you I mean you're adding
that to an already you know Highway gear
it'll really help so anyways until next
time we appreciate everything guys see
you

You said:
all right guys welcome to part two of tuning the 2017 Chevy Silverado now again this truck has a 5.3 L with a 6
l8e transmission it has been upgraded with a BTR stage 2 l83 Truck cam shaft
so yesterday's video we went over how to make the thing idle and just kind of the basics of tuning a torque model what
adjustments need to be made to the vve table pretty much just what needs to be done to make the truck idle and be able
to drive around so today we're going to dive into what needs to be adjusted for the fuel lobe what needs to be adjusted
for the variable cam timing and what needs to be adjusted to actually make the truck drive nice on the street I
figured a lot of you guys don't really have access to a Dyno some of you do some of you don't because of that I
figured we'll make the majority of the adjustments today while driving on the street now obviously on wide open throttle I need to go on the dyno for
that kind of purpose you guys you can use your racetrack or wherever else you need to make the adjustments because whether you have a Dyno or not the
adjustments are going to be the same so let's go ahead on and dive into the tuning process and we'll get started
[Music] all right so we've got our tune file pulled back up the next thing we need to
do is we need to adjust for our fuel lobe so this application has a 14% fuel
lobe if you look on your cam card or you can also see it on btr's website you'll know your fuel lobe size now what we
need to do is we need to tell the ECM that the fuel lobe has been changed the reason being is because now our high
pressure fuel pump is going to move more volume so we need to let the truck no hey this fuel pump is moving more volume
we need to understand what to do with it super simple adjustment all you got to do is go up to a fuel system you're going to go over to General and you're
going to notice your pump type and your pump type on this truck is going to be a Leading Edge the majority of the GM vehicles is going to be Leading Edge so
you come over here to fuel pump and then you go down the leading edge angle and the only adjustment we need to make to this table is we need to open up our axi
which again if you guys ever see the axis that are underline like this that means you can alter the values in there so we're going to open up our axi and
since we've got a 14% fuel LOE we're just going to increase this by 14% so multiply *
1.14 and that's it that's the only adjustment we need to make for the fuel Lo so the next thing we need to adjust is the variable cam timing tables so
we're going to go to engine airflow variable cam shaft and now this cam shaft comes with a 4 degree limiter now if it was a stage one really this truck
could probably get away with it as well but I personally like the stage ones with no limiter and that way you can the cam shaft real heavily at
light throttle so I know a lot of you guys will pull up your tables like your VVT tables and you'll see this area
right here and you think oh they did that for emissions well they did it for a number of reasons but emissions is one but fuel economy is another big reason
so when you heavily the cam shaft like this you reduce pumping loss in the engine and the engine actually becomes
more efficient going down the interstate so if you alter this table right here and you get rid of that real heavy cam
shaft on your vehicle it will become more responsive but you also usually lose in a truck like this you're
going to lose 1 to 1 and a half mile per gallon just from touching that in this application we're just going to tune the
cam shaft according to what James short said to do at BTR just know that if you've got a smaller cam shaft you can
play around with retarding it really heavily in these areas you'll be surprised that the kind of fuel mileage increased you'll get we're going to go
ahead on and make this adjustment so if you notice on this cam card it stops at 7,000 RPM and it starts at 4600 so if
you look up here on your axi your axi doesn't match well you can make it match if you want to so if we want to come up
here we can just follow what the cam card says so 7,000 at the top
6800 okay so they're just going down by 200 so I'll go and make that
adjustment all right so now that the axi has been set up all we've got to do is we can just go on and just zero this
table out if we want we'll just zero it all right so now that we have a zero out table we know at 5200 it wants one
degree 5400 it wants 2° and 5600 it wants 2 and 1 half now you'll notice
that there's no decimal point here if you want to add a decimal point you just come up here to increase decimal and now that we've got a decimal point there so
5600 it wants 2 and 1/2 three 3 and 1/2 and then four from 6200 up now if you
lost your cam card there is a PDF download on btr's website you just search whatever cam shaft you have and
they'll have the download for this cam card so now that we've got that done and I don't know if I said but where I
started out at was desired angle these right here are based off of barometric pressure so where I live we're going to
be in the high area but you can go and make adjustments to all of them and we're only working on intake cam shaft
exhaust cam shaft obviously we don't have because we've only got one cam shaft so if you look these tables aren't even populated from GM so you don't have
to worry about this side at all so all you got to do is go over to medium and we're going to paste it in low and again when you click up at the top it
highlights all control C for copy on the high table and then control+ V to paste it in so you can use this as well you
can hit copy and then paste it there as well we're going to go under whatt desired angle and we're going to paste that in and that's it we don't have to
touch anything else that's got everything under control now if you plan on revving the truck out higher than
normal BTR stage through Truck cam does not necessarily want anything above like it'll make power to 7,000 but in a truck
application we don't need to use that just note that at the bottom down here under enable conditions you'll see where there's a low RPM enable low RPM disable
but there's a high as well so if you get a high RPM enable you'll see this a set 6800 which our rev limiter set below
that but if your rev limiter is higher than that make sure you increase this table because if you don't that little bit of intake camera that you have
is going to go away it's going to go to zero once you go above this threshold just keep that in mind so that was set to 68 on the truck and then 7,000 right
here so you'll want to increase that so say you want to go up to 7500 then just increase those tables accordingly so now
that we've got that done we're going to go ahead on load this in and I'm going to drive the truck so right now we're
still on stock transmission tune I have made some torque model adjustments I have brought in a vve table that I like
I've done a couple things in the background if you need to understand how to do that reference yesterday's video or a lot of the other Gen 5 videos that
I have we talk about vve tuning we talk about torque model tuning I haven't adjusted the trend so we're going to not
write the TCM and we're we're going to load this into the ECM we're going to go for a drive all right so I've got the truck outside first thing you want to do
before you actually go driving on the street since we're going to be doing some transmission tuning we want to reset the adaptiv on it and we want to
make sure that our long-term fuel trims are reset so right now I'm going to scroll down to long-term fuel trims and they should be off because I went ahead
on disabled them if you know how to disable them I've talked about that in other videos as well so you can reference back the other Gen 5 videos if
you need to clear them all you got to do is well connected to the truck you come up here to vehicle controls and special options and you'll go down to engine
fuel and then long-term fuel trim reset you can click that and it'll wipe those out now if the truck is running it may
not clear right away you may have to push it a couple times or if you want you can just key on the vehicle connect to the truck with it not running and
it'll clear out that way so the next thing we want to do is like I said we want to reset our adaptiv now this is going to be critical on any 6l80 6 L90 8
L90 if you get one that has really poor shifting habits if it has clunky shifts things like that Transmissions it's
still in good shape all you got to do is reset the adaptiv and go from there these Transmissions will learn basically what they're doing is you have a table I
shouldn't just say a table it's got an entire shift time schedule that basically tells the TCM okay this is how
long we want it to take for each shift it will learn bad habits from different fluid temperatures different clutch pack
Heights you know if your clutches are worn fluids worn if the transmission temp's been overheated a couple times it
will learn bad habits this truck's at 116,000 miles on it so when we want to start off with transmission tuning we want to start with with no
adaptivesportsmen.org to do that you go to transmission automatic and then you're only going to click these top three buttons we're not worried about
the trans fast learn we're not worried about the trans clean procedure these are used in more of a shop environment
the trans fast learn what that is is basically get your transmission temp I believe you go up to like 153 degrees on
transmission temp or so you push down the parking brake and then you follow like you actually log the channel for
Trans fast learn if you guys want a video on that I can show yall doing that and the truck doesn't work as good it works good in like the g8s and fit in
Camaros and things like that the B you just follow directions it'll tell you to put it and drive and the engine and trans go through a procedure to where
the the TCM starts to learn the oncoming and off-going preset pressures it'll actually apply gears and it figures out
exactly how much it takes to apply that gear and it'll actually back off pressure to determine the least amount of pressure it takes to hold that gear
and it just automatically learns that way I don't recommend that on the trucks again the trucks a lot of the times they'll fail a lot of the times they are
hard to get the transmission even up to temperature especially if you've done the updated thermostat in the side of the trans so I just don't recommend that
the best thing to do is is you click the top three buttons and again only the top three buttons now if you'll notice
there's no popup there's no nothing like that just know that when you click it if it's connected to the scanner the adapter has been reset so now when you
go to drive it it may shift kind of funny at first you may have some weird flares you may have some Miss shifts
things like that usually within the first 2 or three miles everything will be corrected sometimes it takes longer if you got a really worn out
transmission like I think yesterday or day before I was also tuning on an 8l 90 truck and that truck the transmission
was not in good shape so I cleared the adaptiv and I had to drive it like 20 miles before it got to the point where it wasn't flaring each shift
traditionally in a 6l80 truck we can tune on coming in off-going preset pressures to help offset that and the
ad8 L90 trucks we can't so we can adjust shift times we can adjust shift pressures but oncoming and off-going is
not accessible on 90 I'm not sure if they even use that logic I would assume that they do don't quote me on that now
that the transmission has been reset truck's warming up right now you'll see we're still a little low on ignition
timing against not a huge deal right now the truck's actually idling really really really smooth and we've got good manifold vacuum so honestly if it stays
like this I may increase the idle timing just a little bit but man I mean the way the truck feels right now actually feels
really good one thing I I will want to address is I do need to bring down the rail pressure some and when you bring
down the rail pressure what it's going to do is it's going to increase your injector pulse width at idle and by doing that we should be able to smooth
out the engine a little bit more I'm not sure why but on these like 2017 2018 trucks GM has this really funky section
of super high rail pressure they may have a reason for or I shouldn't say they may I know they have a reason for
that but the earlier trucks didn't have that it doesn't make sense to me so I'll go ahead on and I'll put them back to like a 2015 style table and the trucks
are happy anyways let's go ahead on and drive this thing and collect some data you'll notice that we're just working with short-term fuel Trims and the
reason why I do this is especially with aftermarket exhaust aftermarket cam shafts long-term fuel trims can learn
bad habits but I've never seen any negative side effects from having long-term fuel trims disabled the
positives of it are when customers have headers like this when they eventually burn a plug wire the long-term fuel
trims don't learn that misfire once the customer fixes the misfire I'm not getting phone calls on hey my truck's
running funny now that I fixed the misfire and it's because of the imbalance of fuel trims it also won't carry fuel trims through wide open
throttle I like these trucks to be as consistent as possible so as we're driving right now I'm noticing a little bit of flares but it's not bad so it
honestly feels like this transmission is in pretty good shape again you'll know when they're in bad shape when you reset the adapter IV and they'll almost feel
like they put you in neutral for a couple seconds before it shifts that's usually a sign of it's a warn trans fuel
trims are still looking good V air flow is matching pretty well now again I did pull in a vve table that I use as a base
now keep in mind when I'm doing remote tuning I don't just slam a vve table in there and just call it good every time
the customer drives it I'll make a MAF and vve change especially when they have a ton of data so the good thing about
doing Street tuning like this is you can collect a ton of data on the dyno I just
don't have the fans to actually keep up with the amount of temperature that this truck's going to create if I'm just running steady state on the dyno like
that so usually what I'll do is my normal tuning process would be if I'm not on camera is truck would go into
open loop I would dial in the math curve loaded on the dyno I would sweep through the vve table make sure everything's
good go through wide open throttle and then I'd get on the street and I'd use the short-term fuel trims just to finish dialing in everything when you're tuning
your own vehicle you want to take as much data as possible you're driving to work and you've got a 20 30 45 minute
drive to work or longer data log at all the more average data you can get on
fuel Trims and vve and everything else the better off it's going to be so right
now we're pulling up a little bit of a grade I don't know what fuel this truck is on but you'll see that the knock sensors are going off a little bit right
now I'm not concerned with it I'm just going to continue to drive the truck so this truck will adapt you've got your
knock learn Factor where it constantly goes between the high octane and low octane ignition timing tables
so this truck will actually learn that knock on whatever fuel we're on and it will actually turn itself down to the
low octane table so I'm not not super worried about that but otherwise I'm
just going to drive this truck for the next couple minutes and collect as much data as I can now as I'm driving if I
want more vve data uh all I got to do is I can pull this truck down into the manual mode and you'll see where RPMs
increased and now we're filling up that section of the vve T you can downshift
upshift whatever you need to do the more you work on the light throttle stuff the better off it's going to be for low
speed transmission shifting I know a lot of you guys will run into excessive torque management and excessive shift
times the more low speed stuff the more accurate that vve table is the better off everything is including your
transmission that's why I'm going to always push for vve tuning the correct way and trying to get it as dialed as
humanly possible so like right now we're doing well I guess we're doing like 6 67 but if the truck will let me downshift
I'll go and downshift it again you know we're we're still just collecting data and you'll see in those areas that my V
airflow table is a little bit farther off in this High vacuum area on this specific truck that little bit of a drive the one two shift feels good 23 is
still flaring so I have a feeling that I'm going to need to make uh at least an oncoming preset pressure change to the
23 but I also have not touch touched shift times I haven't touched torque management I haven't touched anything on
this truck so as of right now we're 13 minutes into this drive and I'm almost back to the
shop so I'm going to continue to collect this data and then we'll make some adjustments from there all right so
we're back at the shop now and we're going to go ahead on and look at the data so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to pull up shortterm field
terms versus math now if you need to know how to do this table all you got to do is right click graphs layout you come
up here to add graph you can add table you can click parameter and you can type in stft this
top is the search bar you would just click short-term fuel trim where it's not bank one or Bank two you just do it
as a generic you would change unit to percent decimals to however many you want so we'll say we'll just do one
decimal column axi parameter is going to be mass airf flow sensor frequency right here masterful sensor
frequency it's going to pop up would I like to use generic sure Yes sounds good and then you're going to go over here to
your table find our math calibration go to airflow versus frequency and then what you're going to do is you're going to right click column axi we're going to
going to copy the labels and then all I got to do is come in here and paste it so that has our short-term field trim
versus math table so now all I've got to do is we pull that up and it'll be populated if you want to change to where
like I like to do it whereas like if it's lean so let's go short-term field trims we'll say high value of 25 low
value of - 255 and then obviously a high value is going to be lean so you can make the color red if you want to make
uh low value which would be rich you want to make it green and that will change the color so it'll kind of give
you an idea as to how far off you are now the farther off you are the darker the colors will be but you'll see that
we're pretty close now some of this data is not going to be correct you'll notice how it goes from 2 and 1 12% to 7% what
you want to do is you want to increase your sale counts to where you're getting basically the cell counts is how many hits it takes to actually fill that data
in so we're going to go back short-term field trims graph layouts go back down here to short-term field Trims and you
right now you'll notice that the cell hits required are zero so that means if it even kind of hits that frequency see whatever is in that data it's going to
populate it so for driving around I like to make this 100 so if you notice how when I went to 100 that seven went away
and that's because we really didn't stay in that spot long enough to actually do something good with it so that's how far off we are we're actually pretty
freaking close and honestly the more I drive it the better off it'll be now again this truck has a stock airbox on it so the math should be pretty close
especially part throttle wide open throttle you're going to have to add some fuel to it cuz the engine is obviously moving more air but for the
most part Factory table looks good now we're going to go to my my D Air versus vve error table and again if you want
this style set up you can go to the website and buy the layout but this is going to tell me roughly how much I'm off on vve so you'll see it looks like
I'm a little bit off in like the mid throttle ranges nothing nothing terrible though I mean 7% is not bad up here got
15% we're starting to drift off a little bit so not bad so I'm going to make these adjustments now if you want to know how to take these adjustments and
and put it into your table the black C7 Corvette video I did a few videos ago
shows you the exact process of how I average things and do all that stuff so I'm going to make an adjustment to vve
but everything else is honestly looking good so I'm going to make these adjustments we're going to go back out and drive it and then what we'll do is
while we're out on the street I'm going to give you guys an idea of how the transmission feels now that these adjustments are made and if we have to
make some transmission adjustments we'll go into that keep in mind right now we're driving stock shift Point stock shift time stock everything so we'll go
through that process as well so I'm going to make these adjustments and I'll be back all right so I went ahead on made those vve adjustments I also made
some torque model adjustments to get the ignition timing up to where I wanted it like I said this truck being a stock
converter truck I wanted it to have low double digit timing numbers now right
now the AC's on I kick the AC off and the timing you'll see here AC is off
now all right I just heard it disengage you'll notice that we're hovering right there around that 9 to 10° that that
should be a happy spot for this truck so kick the kick the defrost and heat back on and let's go ahead on and go for
another drive now again you want to make sure all this stuff is dialed in before you start working on your transmission
because your transmission is torque-based and so shift Times line pressure you name it everything is based
off of airflow model which is based off of torque model everything works together so when you're working on these
just look at it as you can't just adjust one thing at a time you've got to kind
of make small adjustments to everything all at once so you'll see right now of
course I did just flash the truck and just start it back up so with any of the GM vehicles I know a
lot of you guys ask about the rich after flash just give it some time like just
let everything settle in there is an offset versus injector temp table that you can you can zero it out on Gen 4 and
it does seem to help but every one of these GM vehicles after you flash it takes it a minute to actually get
settled in and be happy so one two shift was pretty good 23 shift was so
so 34 definitely had a flare now I'm showing a bunch of knock right now but
again as we drive this truck everything is going to settle in so we'll just keep
working through it now every time you flash it it does divert back to I believe this thing reverts back to the
hotan table I'm 99% sure it reverts back to oane every time you flash it and I'm not sure
what fuel this truck is even on yeah I mean I'm just going to assume 87
octane so right now again not concerned about the knock the knock since are
doing their job they're completely stock sensitivity uh I have not checked the engine mount on this truck yet so we
haven't got to that point yet when I start it I do kind of feel that little
bit of a shake to where I almost feel like the motor mount could be bad so as we talked about before in these videos
almost every GM truck has a broken motor mount I swear it's I don't know why GM cannot get their motor mount situation
straightened up but pretty much ever since ' 07 like the 9906 trucks they
still would have motor mount issues but it wasn't near as bad as 07 and newer and I was hoping this new body style was
going to completely resolve that issue it hasn't so especially with set of headers on here we may actually be
seeing some false knock from a week motor mount uh if you notice I'm doing the exact same type of acceleration and
I'm going uphill right now and the knock sensors aren't going off so that right there tends to make me believe that we
probably have a motor mount issue so we'll check it when we get back to the shop but right now just driving it
letting everything get settled in as you can see fuel trims are starting to come back into alignment the vve table is
starting to come back into alignment so everything is starting to get happy transmission feels okay again I'm
on stock shift point so there's a couple different ways that you can go about adjusting the shift points on these trucks it really when it comes down to
shift points shift points are more about personal preference so I've showed you guys in my 6l80 video I showed you how
to use a bluecat tool bluecat tool Works absolutely fantastic I mean that that thing if you use the settings like I
used in bluecat if you're more of a uh we'll say spirited driver that goes up
and down a lot of hills and things like that using the settings that I showed in that 6L video really makes these trucks
feel good but as you start to get into more of the flat areas some guys don't
like how easy it is to downshift so another thing that you can do to adjust
shift points is going to be just base everything off of percentages so we know that this truck I think the factory on
this truck is like a 5800 RPM shift so with this cam shaft we could have it wide open throttle shift at say 62 or
6300 and the truck be happy so if you want you can actually do the math you can just take you know say you want 6300
RPM shifts you can go go 6,300 divided by 5800 and of course I'm driving right now
but that's probably like four or 5% and you can literally just go to your upshift and downshift tables both normal
what everything and multiply it by that percentage and it will increase every shift and every downshift in that same
percentage to where you have more of a factory like shift point to where they're kind of lazy on downshifts but
but again it's just personal preference so as I'm driving this truck I'm going to figure out exactly how I want it to
shift I don't know if I'm going to use bluecat or not I do think I'm going to lower shift times a little bit so we'll
go through that procedure we'll probably lower them I don't know like we'll probably do a multiplier of like 75 or8
just to make it shift a little bit faster but this truck is not a race truck I don't believe the customer wants
to race it so the goal for for me in this truck is going to be to maintain as
OE like drivability as possible while just having it feel better all the way around so I'm just going to continue to
drive and collect data as you can see there's some spots in the low RPM higher
load that I'm off so the goal though is just to collect as much data as humanly
possible especially you know if you drive in the same Loop every day like I said driving back and forth to work
you're going to experience that stuff to where you can really dial in those tables for your exact application now
ideally the the the way the manufacturer dials these in I wish I could dial one in like that basically you know they're
on an engine Dyno temperature fixed everything is fixed they can control the load they can apply however much load
they want at whatever RPM they want I could technically do a lot of that with
the dyno but you it comes down to cooling for the engine engine for cooling for
the trans cooling for the rear end cooling for the tires a lot of guys don't think about the fact that when
you're on a Dyno for a very long period of time those tires get hot so if you watch somebody like Gail Banks or one of
the guys that really do heavy Engineering in like in truck applications you'll see they'll put fans
on the tires they'll have fans underneath the trans pan cuz you got to think a lot of your cooling capacity for the trans comes from the airflow passing
the transmission pan itself so when you're on a Dyno you need some air flow going across that transmission fan so I
wish I could do that so the goal is just to collect as much data as possible so this is where the differences start to
come in between a dino tune and a remote tune so with a dino tune you know a lot
of these guys just Factor they'll make sure idle is good they'll put well goodish they'll put it on the dyno
they'll dial it in they'll overtime the engine they'll lean it out too far they'll do all this stuff and they'll
send it out the door this is where remote tuning dominates if you the end user are actually in
control of the data logs the more data you get your tuner the better off you are so again if you take these 45-minute
drives and every data log you send your tuner with a 45-minute drive along with some wide open throttle pools or
whatever they're wanting you would be surprised at just how good you can get that engine dialed so my personal
preference is going to be to like if if especially a local customer I like to
dial them in as much as I can in person but ideally I would love for them to have their own HP tuners in pvi 3 or
similar cable and I'd love for them to take data logs after the fact send them to me also as you can tell I love to
educate people and let you guys know how to do it so the end goal of all of my videos are going to be to hold people
accountable I'm tired of seeing these keyboard warriors on Facebook pages on
YouTube places like that where they're trying to sell you on doing Tunes but they put the least amount of effort
in as possible you know like even my remote tune stuff there's no time limit you know as long as you're not changing
parts you know I had a customer earlier today email me saying that hey you know he had a crankshaft seal fail on an LT
which hot tip the LT crankshaft seals suck both front rear Mains that inverted
seal is absolute garbage the fix go back to LS3 seals but anyways obviously where
he's at super cold outside shops backed up on work he's like hey can I get back
to you in April absolutely like just as long as you're not changing any type of major parts the time limit doesn't
expire I want everybody's vehicle as dialed in as humanly possible cold starts hot starts you know vve table
being dialed math dialed in so that's just my process and I don't want to make this sound like it's just a big
advertisement for remote tuning fortunately it has worked out that way to where I have got a lot of
advertisement from this but like I said I want to teach you guys how to do this stuff stuff so more data you can as
possible always a good thing there's an entire group of massive birds that I'm
yeah okay they moved focus on getting as much data as possible even if you got a race car whether it's on Holly whether
it's stock ECU whatever there's no sense in your race car starting like work
on it take the data you know with Holly I can I can do a video on this if you want but you can export your logs on
Holly to tuner Studios and actually like use megga log viewer to graph out
histograms just like this and you can take all your clothes Loop data You Can Have a Holly just as dial as you can on
stock ECU and then some so anyways I'm
going to quit rambling I'm going to continue to take this data right now you know 73 mph down the interstate trucks
cruising good transmission temps are good so I have 144° transmission temp
engine temps 16 these Gen 5 thermostats are kind of shitty apparently I had a 15 model Yukon
that I bought new and even earlier miles like lower miles on them thermostats
just suck they don't hold temp so I don't know if it's just they put too much cooling capacity on the radiators
or what but I mean we're 167° and I mean this truck's been driving for a while
you know I I would love for these trucks to keep that temperature up because I know a lot of you guys like the colder
Temp and realistically like for road course applications for drag racing things like that lower temp sure it
works good but for everyday usage getting these engines up to Temp reduces
emissions it it increases fuel mileage just everything is happier especially on a DI vehicle they like to be warm the
only like di vehicle that I know of that really likes to be cool is going to be the lt4 and the biggest reason for
keeping the cylinder head temp down on the lt4 is to keep the blower temp down you know you knock 20° off the cylinder
heads off one of those cars that pulls that 20° out of the blower it pulls a 20° off the in cooler it's that much
less heat that you're putting into the system and intake temps are where it's at if you want to make big Power on lt4
especially on pump gas intake temps is that's the critical thing if you're wondering why your 6G ZL1 dyo 50
horsepower less than a lot of the guys look at your manifold air temp so especially on lt4 stuff you've got i1 I2
I3 a lot of guys are watching their i1 which is at the air tube itself at your
math we're not that's irrelevant almost I mean you want to have that for data manifold air temp is what you need to
focus on so if you're doing a pool and you've got 160° manifold air temp on pump gas that thing's going to have to
be severely under timed to be safe so one thing to keep in mind air charge
temperature that's exactly where it's at you always want to do as many upgrades as you can to reduce air charge temp
almost done with the street portion of this I'm going to drive this a little bit more get some more data but but once
I finish up this round I may go one more loop I don't know if it'll be on camera or not and then we'll get this thing on
the dyno we'll get this thing dialed in now again as far as shift points go when I get back to the shop I'll kind of show
you I'll show you the percentage process first since I've already showed you the blue capat process again it's personal preference
so that's one thing you know as I'm tuning for customers I'll have some guys say hey this thing downshifts too much
hey it doesn't downshift enough shifting is is personal preference the cool part about these trucks is you got tow Hall
that you can utilize as well if you want to do percentage base shifts you know on
normal map and then you want to have a little bit more spirited like blue cat with uh sensitive downshifts on tow hul
you can do it that way you utilize the factory functions of these vehicles as much as humanly possible it's really
nice having multiple transmission Maps like honestly I wish this body style truck had the mode button to where I
could actually you know turn the knob and have Sport and have all this other stuff but unfortunately we don't but
anyways drive back to the shop or I'm going to drive back to the shop work on shift points and we'll keep making these
adjustments all right so let's go ahead on talk transmission adjustments so like I said I want to reduce shift times on
this truck just a little bit nothing crazy so what you're going to do is you're going to go under trans shift timing and we're just going to work on
these torque outer tables basically all these let's do a uh let's do a 75 multiplier now we're not going to adjust
anything else you know you don't really have to go through on a truck like this especially stock converter it's not
being raced on a factory tire it's factory all that stuff just some small changes will make all the difference in
the world on how that truck drives so right now all I'm doing is I'm going through the 1 two 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 on
both normal and special I'm not going to touch the 13 I'm not going to touch any of those other ones so all we're going
to do this right here is going to reduce the amount of time that the TCM is looking to command for the shift so when
you have those just kind of lazy shifts where there feels like there's a long pause so just not with that long pause
is the truck whatever the shift time is set to now the truck has a big algorithm where it uses transition time desired
output Factor inertia uses all these to develop an algorithm to where it it's
basically trying to set up the best shift for each throttle position for like Ford calls it a change of mind
shift but all we're doing is we're just going to make this is essentially the table that we're adjusting on right now is essentially the base table and so
when you reduce it you reduce it it's basically reducing everything globally so by reducing it by 25% we're going to
have a 25% faster shift now what it the process is the TCM has a shift time that
it's looking for it adjusts oncoming and off-going preset pressures itself using
adaptivesportsmen.org
before the shift right say 6,000 RPM it's you're commanding the shift all of a sudden it flares up that needs more
oncoming preset pressure so say it goes through and makes the one two shift and
it's fine but when it's in a second gear when the RPM comes down and there's a flare right there and then it pulls
itself down that's off-going preset pressure so you've got oncoming that's holding one gear off-going is holding
the next and you're trying to make those to happy to where they don't bind they don't do anything like that so that's kind of like the short rundown on
oncoming and offg goinging preset pressures those things to adjust those those are going to be under shift pressures and under adaptive and you'll
see oncoming preset pressures here labeled by what gear and by what mode you're in so when you see special
special is going to be your tow hul mode in this truck application so if you want to find out you can go under shift
General and it'll show you the different patterns and then so you if you datal log the patterns so like right now the
truck's running let me go down to shift pattern and you're going to see trans shift mode is normal let me put the
truck in the drive so we're still in normal so that means we're on the normal
schedule so we're on the normal up shifts down shifts we're as far as shift
timing goes we're on the normal side for this torque Adder right here so watch what happens when I push to
Hall and now you'll see we're in pattern a so if we want to make an adjustment
for the shift schedule for pattern a you shift shift scheduling you'll see
pattern a right is right here but also note that it's going to use the special pressures for shift times it's going to
use it for line pressure things like that so that's just the kind of the quick rundown I talked a little bit more about this in my 6l80 video but let's
let's just do normal mode right now for shift points to where we're just going to globally increase it so like I said
the easiest way of doing this is doing okay so we got 5600 RPM shift so let's say we're going to shift this truck
let's let's do 6200 for for reference so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go under Tools calculator make this a b
smaller all right so 6200 divided by 5600 equals and so
that's a 10% difference on shift speed so all we got to do is we can copy this
number and you can go under upshift highlight all paste in your
number up here multiply you can do the same for downshifts and you can do the same thing
for each gear Now using this doing it in this manner is gonna have the downshifts
upshifts torque converter everything like Factory just elevated 10% obviously
so I'm going to do that to these shifts I'm not a big fan of this keypad
or this touchpad on this laptop it's a lot bigger and it's a lot more sensitive
than the old computer that I was used to I know first world problems
right all right so under under Full Throttle shift r R PM we just go under here we know it was going to be a
roughly a 600 RPM increase let's just do 600 R oh not times let's just do a 600
RPM increase across the board we'll do that for fifth gear as well even though
the truck would never hit this or I hope not I hope you aren't pushing these trucks up into fifth gear that high not
with a stock drive shaft at least but either way we'll just make our changes uniform like that keeping that number
that saved multiplier let's go into torque converter apply relase let's move it all up the same
way and it's going to max out at 318 up here anyways so we that's that's
fine but if you make these changes in a uniform manner like that you're going to maintain that uniform shifting so I like
I said I'll have some customers that don't want it to downshift especially once you once you regear these trucks
you know I've got a lot of trucks from like 35s with like a 456 Gear with a 6l80 where it's got just a lot of gear
ratio and they don't like to downshift as much Full Throttle we're going to do the
same thing and so kind of It kind of works out good because when you do it in a
percentage base like this obviously with a larger cam shaft it shifts the entire
torque curve over so by the cam shaft shifts torque curve over you shift the
shift schedule over to match it so if you think about it it just it
just it it simplifies everything everything so that's good right there
now while we're on the subject of torque converter some of you guys like to delay them till third or fourth gear it's
completely fine Factory knew what they were doing now they do ask for a lot of TCC slip so
we can go under here and we can go and zero out the desired slip tables now this is this part right here
has kind of been controversial um I've had some guys say that with this
converter clutch material that you have to keep some slip in there I mean my last Yukon I think I
sold it with like 240,000 mil on it the TCC slip tables were zeroed out since day one and it was on the factory trans
Factory torque converter Factory everything with no issues I had it locking up in second gear I was doing
all the same stuff cuz obviously locking up in a lower gear does help fuel mileage some it also just makes the
truck feel a little bit better in my opinion as far as like light throttle driving goes but doing it like that
handles that part so I'm going to go ahead on and input the data that I saw from that
last data log so I'll dial in the math again vve adjustment again and then load
the ECM tune with this Trans Tune into the truck and I'm going to drive it one more time all right tune file has been
loaded in I'm going to go ahead on and I'm going to reset the adaptiv again because I adjusted shift time
and I'm going to try to get an idea of if we need to make an oncoming or off-going preset pressure change with
this now hopefully this is the final drive for the truck as far as on camera goes uh usually what I'll do is after
the dyno I'll take them back out because on the dyno I'm going to be making timing adjustments I'm going to be making torque model adjustments I'm
going to be working on possibly Peak torque actually we'll take that back this truck shouldn't need any Peak torque adjustments um but either way
as it's starting to get final dialed you just keep testing and just keep testing and just keep going until it drives
exactly the way you want it to this truck is on a completely stock driver demand table driver demand and these are
pretty good in the 171 18 models now they do need work in the earlier models for sure so we're seeing that knock
again I still forgot to check the motor mount nothing audibly going on and
honestly whenever it picks up like that it just feels like the truck just got neutered with power so that's I I'm
pretty sure it's false but again I'm doing light light throttle driving not too concerned about it right
now but so far I mean the truck seems to be driving good it idles
good so I'm just going to keep going so getting on the interstate now fuel trims
are starting to settle in really nice as we've talked about in other videos from the manufacturer they're
usually 5 6 7% % off sometimes as much as 10% off on fuel trims you don't have
to sweat the fuel trims now if it's your personal vehicle and you have plenty of time to take data by all means get those
suckers as dialed as humanly possible but when it comes down to it just
understand that the manufacturers have fuel trims in there for a reason and that these trucks I mean they're you're
going to use them on different fuels at different temperatures things are going to change a little bit so obviously
that's where it comes down to the more data the better but focusing on trying to get the field
trims all plus or minus 2% within an hour or two it's just it's it's hard to
do it really is so but everything's everything's looking good on here vve
tables looking good I mean I'm happy with how this thing's driving the percentage based shift points seem to
feel pretty good on this truck so I I I think I'm going to leave them like this
and see what the customer thinks again if he I don't see any like
evidence that he Towes a lot or anything like that so this thing just being a cruiser these shift points feel really
good so now personally I like my trucks to downshift fairly aggressively but I'm
also a different breed but shift times feel good I don't feel like this truck needs any oncoming or off-going preset
pressure adjustments everything is completing the shift as you can watch the shift right here with torque management everything is Shifting just
nice nice we're not getting crazy aggressive shifts it's not neck snapping you can barely feel the thing shift but
you can just know that it's shifting quickly so overall I'm happy with how the transmission feels in this I may do
some other little tweaks but that'll be on the final drive after the dyno so basically where I'm at right now is I
think it's dno time so I'm going to drive this thing back to the shop and get it strapped down and we'll see what
kind of power this thing makes again I have no idea what feel this truck's on the truck I tuned tuned the last truck I
tuned it had a 220 cam shaft in it and it was lifted on like 33s or
35s stock converter with a 220 cam on 87 octane in a 62 truck and it hated timing
it I mean just hated it so I think the final pull we ended up we were in like the low to mid teens on on ignition
timing and that's just the customer said that he drives on 87 all the time he toes he does things like that so
I I wasn't super thrilled with it but we got the tune dialed in to where the truck safe but yeah so we'll see what
kind of feel this thing's on this truck having a smaller cam shaft and having headers on it it definitely is even even
if the truck's on 87 it's still going to be pretty happy so I would expect this truck's probably going to make stock
airbox stock cap back I think we can see 340 out of it I think that'd be a good number so not especially not knowing
what fuel it's on so I mean I've had these trucks Mak in the like the 360 370 range before when they have a good cold
air and they got a good exhaust on there I've had them make obviously more than that when they're on 93 or even E85 you
know I've crossed 400 horsepower with these l83 before with all the bolt-ons
and a good cam shaft so but I think 340 350 would be a good number for this truck so hopefully it at least gets to
there I think we can the unfortunate thing on the 53 is that their catbacks are really small they have like a 2 and
1/2 in tail pipe on them so these these engines they really do like to breathe but anyways we're back we're almost back
to the shop now so I'll pull this thing in and we'll get it strapped down the dyno and we'll do some rips all right so
going under the truck see if we see any leaks or anything looks like we may have a little
bit of an oil cooler drip right there that motor mount looks new
actually anyways exhaust clearance looks
looks okay oh it's been hitting the cross
member see I don't know if you can see that or not bet that's our false knock
right there you can see all the fresh metal anyways goes three and 1 half to three to the stock cap
back you just see how small this pipe is it's she's not very
big front U joint feels okay okay stock Muffler still has a little
flapper valve in there I don't know if youall seen this but it's at least free it's not
stuck reu joint feels pretty good obviously I didn't feel any vibrations in the truck
so we should be good but these have a little resonator and the little Rinky Dink tail pipe on there so that'll be a
little bit of a restriction but let's get it down and get it strapped onto the dyno and make some power all right truck's on the dyno so what we're going
to do is we are in vehicle simulation mode I'm going to turn off stabil track
if you didn't know on the GM stuff you can turn off stability Track by pushing and holding the button down for 10 seconds now this era of truck once you
get to a certain power level you actually have to disable it in a different manner which would be Shane
Hines I think offers a plug-and-play kit that it I think it goes to the front ABS
sensor and when you trip the switch you can actually do like you know rolling burnouts and all the cool stuff but this
truck doesn't make that kind of power so anyways we're going to go ahead on and start collecting some data now I did
just flash a tune in I went ahead on and had to raise the threshold to where I can hold the truck locked in a specific
RPM and a specific gear I've showed that in other videos if you want to look you'll go to trans and it's commanded
gear control limits I just move this up to 7,200 mph and that way I can use the scanner to actually hold the truck in a
specific gear so right now we're in second gear I'm going to do the majority of the wide
up and throttle stuff in second gear just CU I don't like to have that super long Dyno pull at that rate of speed
that many times so I usually do the Wim throttle fueling in a more loaded version of second gear and then when we
actually do the dyno pulls I'll go third gear this third gear on this truck it's a 342 gear truck I'm pretty sure let's
see edit gear and tire wizard yeah 342 gear so 342 gear and third with the
converter locked it'll probably see 108 M an hour or so and that's really the max you want to see on a stock drive
shaft controls and special functions locked it in second gear converter's locked so let's go ahead on and roll
into the throttle and see how far off our math curve is now I built this math curve based off of the data that we
pulled from the street so you'll see if you're consistent with your street data you'll see how close we are on the wideband
all right so looks like we're basically spot on let's see eqr versus
math I mean we're close so that shows you as long as you're uniform in your
changes and you're really paying attention to what you're doing and you make sure you collect enough data for short-term fuel trims if you keep that
data uniform that's how close your math curve can actually be so now if you
notice how rich the truck is this truck is right now it's on a bone stock timing table like all the I adders
everything is stock the power enrichment table is stock so I'm just dialing it in
like that right now so let me Shut the truck off let me reduce the amount of hits we need on the eqr versus
MAF we'll just take it down zero just kind of get an idea where we're at all right so look like we start the pool and we're
basically dead on from 7950 actually I need to go on to make my axi cuz this is a later model truck so I
don't know if you guys have noticed but in the trucks I think around 16 or 17 they changed the math frequency and I'm
sure I have a layout that's set up for the late truck math frequency but we'll just change it so normally it goes 0 to
15,000 and it goes in like 150 or 150 her increments these are a little bit
different and you can change it a lot of the trucks especially the trucks with aftermarket intakes and stuff I'll go in
and just change the axi back to like the older style and dial it in that way you have all the information in this table
to completely convert over that table cuz like right now if you were to try to input data in and then smooth it's going
to skew your smoothing results because the axi itself isn't smooth so anyways
I'm going to right click Callum axi copy labels go over to eqr versus math I
think the top portion is actually the same but just to make sure we're doing
this right all right so let's go back over 7950 it looks like
we're about 4% Rich up top so not bad at all but this truck has everything still turned on I mean all the knock
enrichment everything is still turned on so we'll make this
adjustment and just going to assume since 9150 was off 4% that up above it we need to
reduce it by 4% so we're going to load this in
let's get an idea actually before I load that in let's get an idea of how far off the VV vve table is up
top ignore that oh we're pretty close so now that I
reduced the math down it's going to make this top part of the table basically dead on from what I can tell so I'm
going load this in and then we'll do another hit all right so we got that tune file loaded in now one thing this a little tip that I want to show you guys
I've showed you in other videos but just to make sure if you notice I haven't changed the name of this tunee file at all the reason being is because HP
tuners automatically not only do they automatically save your logs but they automatically save your tune changes so
a lot of guys will make tune changes and they're like I made a mistake I need to go back all you've got to do is
come up here if I can get it to pull up and see what it actually says all right it's not pulling up anyways this little paper piece of paper with the clock so
this will actually show you your saved history logs so say I want to make a change this shows you how many times
I've made changes just today on on this file if you want you can open up this one and you'll see that under engine I
changed stuff that's under Fuel and Spark so if you want you can actually right click it and open as compare file
and now that specific tune is in the compare file so you can see the differences we can go to compare view
comparison log and you'll see that I changed the math calibration in that one
so super simple like it just makes it nice and easy all your changes are
always saved notice how this says base this is the initial where you open the
file up so usually it's your initial read file so say you make a bunch of changes and you forget to save the stock file if you click this paper button with
the clock you can go back to your base it's there it's saved automatically HP tuners
they got it dialed when it comes they save your tunes automatically and they save your logs automatically thought
that was a cool little tip for you guys saw somebody post on the Facebook page yesterday one of the HP tuners Facebook
pages about the saved logs and they didn't know about that so now you know it saves your tunes as well all right so
let's start this Data Logger up again we're still in vehicle simulation mode again timing tables
Factory power enrichment tables Factory knock enrichments there everything is still
there so we'll go and get this thing up in a second gear controls the special
functions lock it in the second gear and let's do it
hit all right so stop the scanner and if you didn't know you can start and stop the scanner with a space
bar I have a like seven tips and tricks for HP tuners video If y'all go back in my videos you can see all this stuff but
I still like to try to remind you guys sometimes
all right so you can see we're much closer right now and all I'm doing is I'm I'm taking actual versus commanded
so and I'm making the adjustments in the math so this is looking pretty good need some small
changes and then we can go to the vve table and look at it all right so you'll notice how the math changes change the V
table and that's because we're building the V table based off of the math because the math is a dynamic air flow
hopefully you guys are starting to catch on that once we get all this stuff to J makes everything happy so I'm going to
go ahead on and make the change to the math again and while I'm at it I'm going
to go in and make a ve table change now ignore this uh -3 right here
that's just when I lifted off the throttle but all this stuff's going to be accurate so we're close up the very
very top we're four five 6% off in the mid-range so I will make this adjustment
and we'll do another hit and we just basically that's the process is you just keep going till the vve is dialed MAF
has dialed and then I'll turn on the dyno and we can maybe try to feed it a little bit of timing not sure how much
timing this thing is going to want just because it is like I confirmed with the guys it's on 87 octane so it's not going
to want a whole whole bunch but anyways I'm going to make these changes and we'll be back so as I'm making vve
adjustments just want you guys to be able to see what the final V table is looking like so you see it turns out
looks halfway decent so again this right here this shape is the
torque curve and everything's lining up like it's supposed to all right tune files loaded in we're going to do
another hit in vehicle simulation mode now some of you guys may be wondering why I'm not doing dno numbers why I'm not all I'm trying to do right now is
get an airflow model straightened up so we want math to the point to where it will achieve whatever commanded power
enrichment we actually set we want the vve table to match we want just want to
make sure everything is happy so you know there's a lot of guys that'll go through wide open through all stuff
and they're just like okay it'll be happy at 26 de and I don't know 128 air
fuel and they just assume that's just how every truck's going to be and they just put that in every single truck that's not how the process goes so again
right now I'm on stock timing tables I'm on stock everything is stock when it comes to fueling as far as power
enrichment goes like you can literally pull up my power enrichment table right now
you'll see knock enrichment is the only thing that I just turned off and that's because on a DI vehicle a lot of the
times extra fuel doesn't help knock you'll end up with a fuel knock with a rich condition and it can essentially
cause a misfire but EQ ratio gas you'll see it's a bone stock table so all I'm trying to do is make sure it all matches
so in second gear converter's locked let's roll into it again
so vve table is looking good just ignore the coast down stuff we're in
deceleration fuel cut off right now so all that stuff's not going to line
up all right so I'm going to stop the log again let's make this
bigger you'll see here let's make this a different
color so you'll see orange is commanding this light blue is actual and you'll see where they basically overlay each other
so I mean it's it's really hard to get one much better than that now on the
track you could for sure if you had enough track passes but you'll see I mean we're the most we're off is 1%
right here so I'm still going to make that adjustment but I'm just going to multiply by half this time so I'm going
to go down to 7950 and I'll multiply by half and
then now that this this will be adjusted so let's go 7950 so keep in mind I'm
loading up second gear on the dyno pretty heavily we're going to leave all that
alone so that'll be good so now that I'm going to do the third gear PS I'm going
to reduce the Eddie brake to where I don't want to have a legit third gear pull as far as vehicle simulation goes
if you do that if we start at 3,000 RPM and third I if you try that on the street 3,000 RPM and third in a truck like this it'll take
forever to get to your maximum rpm so I do all my math curve adjustments heavily
loaded second gear that way I'm not creating a bunch of heat and then from there on I won't make any more math
adjustments from here as far as wi open throttle goes so I'll load this in let's
stay stock power enrichment table stock timing table let's see what kind of power this thing makes all right Doo's
configured let's get up to third gear again stock power enrichment stock
timing tables we're going to go 3,000 to it's said for 6,200 so still
pull
nope drive shaft did not feel
good drive shaft definitely did not feel good uh yeah yeah I panic
stopped um I made 323 horsepower 336 ft-lbs of torque but
that drive shaft felt like it was about to come out of the truck so we're going to go second gear Instead This
Time well that was kind of creepy I don't think I've ever had this body style truck feel like that at 100
miles hour so I don't know if maybe I mean the U joints felt good good but maybe
there's a little bit of extra slop in the trans tail shaft or I don't know but that was definitely if I had have
continued that pull that drive shaft was coming out so I'm going to let the shop know hey if this
customer he may want to check this stuff out so anyways we are second gear converter locked now and the dyno is
more loaded so it may change the dyno num slightly because we're in such low of gear cuz I think the I think this is
like a 2.06 ratio versus like a 1. 53 but
either way let's do another
pull went a little bit above it just to make sure the dyno gets a gets shut off and applies the brakes and stuff
all right let's get out and see how much power it made all right so that pull it only made
302 with 341 ft-lbs of torque now keep in mind by us dying in second gear we're
not applying as much load on the engine and it's not as close to a 1:1 ratio so
that's why the power dropped but all we're looking for is the fact that it just made 302 is fine we'll make some
adjustments in the tune to try to increase power and so I don't really care what this in number is right here
cuzz I'm going to explain to the custom or explain to the shop why we didn't do a third gear pull but I don't care about
how high this number is I just want to see the differences in if we add timing if we pull fuel whatever we're about to
do we want to make sure this number just keeps going up and we just go into the point where the number stops going up
all right so looking through the data again we're following commanded air fuel just like we're supposed
to I mean it's basically dead on the entire way so
we we're seeing a peak of 16° of ignition timing now I know that's going
to sound low to you guys but in a truck on on 87 octane in a truck that is a
normal timing value for one of these these trucks pick up huge from octane so
93 octane be a whole different story E85 is a way different story this truck
would probably pick up 40 to 50 horsepower on E85 like really easily and
I'm talking about like apples to apples like second gear pull to second gear pull it would pick up that much power on
ethanol so the first thing I want to do is let's lean this thing out just a little bit we're not going to go anything crazy let's go under power
enrichment and what do I want to do let's keep the
no let's just let's let's command our own powerment values all right so I'm going to go from like three or 0 to
3,000 RPM let's go
1.36 now I work with everything in Lambda so if you want to know how to do Lambda power enrichment all you've got
to do is it's one over Lambda so go
1/87 Lambda is 1.49 so 1.36 is going to
be like 88 Lambda which may sound a little bit lean to some of you guys but direct injection vehicles are totally
cool with it but and that's also what we're going to do in the lower RPM region so for right around Peak
torque let's go with a let's do
1.76 then what I'm going to do is I'm going to interpolate horizontally and then for up
top let's go
1.63 yeah let's roll with that so we're going to do a fuel only change and just because I'm OCD like that I'm going to
copy this table and I'm I'm going to put it in the alcohol table as well no timing changes right now just
fuel so I'm going to load this in and we'll see how much power it picks up if it picks up power at all all right so
going back into second gear this is a fuel power enrichment only change so
theoretically this truck should pick up a reasonable amount of power timing is going to be the same now by leaning this
out not only are we running the engine leaner but we're going to put the injection timing back in its more of a happy spot since the truck's making more
power up top theoretically if we wanted to run it that rich we would have needed to make an injection timing change but
this should bring us back down to where our splits like 180° or higher so we're in second gear
locked Doo is started let's do another pull
all right so let's see where we were at on timing look like we lost a little bit of
timing on that one it actually looks like we lost some power yeah
299 but that's going to be from the drop in timing so I was hoping it was going to
be more drastic and show something something cool but it's not so let's go on and put a little timing in this thing
and see what it picks up from there all right so another thing that I wanted to do as I'm putting in timing as well is
it looked like our injection timing is a little bit off so if you watch this split SOI right
here through the pool I like them to be right around
180° and you'll see where once we start to get up top how it starts to fall below that so I'm going to add a little
bit to it so what I do is I graph it out and again if you need to make a graph um this right here shows primary
SOI but that's where I'm at right now so um the parameter I have in here is split SOI the column Maxi is in cylinder air
mass and where you find that is going to be under fuel General scroll down to SOI base and
that's where you pull your axi from that RPM will be the other column or the other the row axi so what I'm going to
do is since I've looked at where we're at I know 5600 is going to need at least another
7° 5800 here let's just do it like this so let's say 5600 let's see how much air mass are we
at 72 is the lowest we went so 72 right here right yeah so we're going
to add 7° here 5800 we were 8° off and I'm
just going to go through here and I'm going to add to the SOI table what I was lacking the difference
between this number and 180° so I'm doing that because I'm going
to run this truck a little bit richer so these trucks are cool with down to like 088 Lambda or so if you're on ethanol
you can get in like the 0.90 Lambda somewhere like that but because the truck it's a heavy truck I'm going to go
ahead on and keep it around 85 Lambda up top 85 86 something like that so because
of that I'm going to make an injection timing change so it's 6,000 we're about 8 degrees off there uh
6200 we're like we'll call it 6°
6400 we were basically good I'm going to add a degree from like
here that's where it was starting to lay over I'm sure that's probably from the exhaust so then I'm just going to
interpolate over horizontally and so we'll keep that table like that so now I'm going to add some timing
let's just go with like uh I don't know I'm going to add two degrees but so when I make timing adjustments on these what
I will always do is I go to the main table now this gas table stock I table
stock GM knew what they were doing when they were making the power enrichment table when they were making the I table
so what we're going to do is I'm going to add remember where we saw like 72 what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to put let's just do 2° and I'm going to I'm just going to smooth it obviously I
don't want there to be less timing in one spot than there is in the other you also don't want to get too aggressive
with these cuz these trucks they definitely will knock on the street for sure especially when
towing um so you don't want to overtime these things now if the exhaust was opened up
more it would be okay or it would be better but then what I'll do is I'm
going compare it back to this file and and you'll see what we ended up adding so I'm going to copy this and I'm going
to transfer it over to the low octane table so high octane low octane they were stock and so now they're just
slightly modified so we'll load in these changes and we'll see if it picks up some power it should pick up I mean it
would I would think it picks up at least 10 so and the guys come out and they check the drive shaft again even though
we did and he brought up a good point this is a two wheel drive truck I don't tune many crew cab two wheel drive
trucks trucks most of the time around here at least the crew cab short beds are four-wheel drives and then the
single cab short beds are two wheel drives so this drive shaft is really long so it could just be that we're just
hitting critical speed which I will always preach to you guys is just be
careful with these trucks on the dyno be careful with them on the street you know again this truck 95 to 100 milph had
that vibration the drive line vibration that I'm feeling is going to feel more
apparent to me cuz the truck strapped down and we're in one spot this guy could take it out on the street and try to do that and not fill that vibration
drive shaft comes out takes out the fuel tank takes out the exhaust takes out everything so there's a there's a very
good reason why they're speed limited the way they are these drive shafts definitely have critical critical speed
so if you want to go faster than that definitely hit up PST or somebody and get you a good drive shaft we're going to get back up in the second gear let me
activate the doo oh of course of course it was all right let me start the doo
I don't know why that happened but I use any desk to run the dino works
really good especially when it's cold like this keeps me from having to get out of the truck so much all right
everything looks good let's do another pull
all right so look like we saw 17° oh we're getting spicy on this
one Let's uh let's see if it picked up some power all right picked up exactly 10
horsepower like exactly so that's cool I need to hang on Save Trace save results
I don't know why those buttons got unchecked but all right let's uh put a littleit more timing into it and see if
it likes it all right so air fuel still looks good let's look at injection
timing looks good there still need to add a little bit more all right so 5600
5600 to the bottom I'm going to add some more so let me add that to it because with the added timing we picked up a
little bit of cylinder air MK cuz the truck was actually making more horsepower or more torque so because of that it moved to the 76 Mark so I'm
going to make a change to injection timing and let's add another I let's try another two degrees all
right two degrees has been added now again please keep in mind power numbers
we're in second gear we we saw there was a 20 horsepower difference just from going from third to Second same tuneup
this truck does have the small exhaust and has a stock airbox so if you're comparing it to what you think you may see just understand if you've got good
exhaust after the W pipe that's definitely going to help um if you got an aftermarket airbox like an s&v or
something that's going to help if you're on a higher octane fuel that's going to help I mean you see we're not running
this thing on a ton of timing and we're only able to run that timing right now because it's cold inside the shop so
with the IAT modifiers they will pull that timing out but right now we're getting full use of this ignition timing
even on 87 because I mean we're 62 De at the like manifold air attemp 62 Dees
like the actual air temp at the airbox is even colder so Do's ready to go again
we got another 2° in it let's see if it picks up another it's probably going to pick up I would assume probably eight
this time but let's see showing some knock on tip end on
that
one all right so we had a PE 18 and 1/2 but pretty much the timing that I put in
it it got mad and yanked it back out so it did pick up a little bit though
let's see got
3132 326 foot PBS of torque so for the next test that we want to do
let's put some fuel back in this thing and see if it actually likes the added fuel some of these trucks there's in
balance on fuel injectors especially with 100 and some odd thousand miles to where they may not actually like the
commanded EQ to actually be as Lan as what I'm running it on basically the commanded EQ that I'm at is what I've
learned works really good on a full bolt-on truck on E85 or 93 octane with a cam shaft but you know what let's uh
let's put the table back to stock completely and see if it picks up any more power I mean it very well may it
may like stock fueling on this truck again again this is why we test so I'm going to go all the way back to stock
I'm going to leave the ignition timing alone and we'll see if by adding the fuel the knock goes away and the truck
still picks up power so we we'll just we're testing so I'm going to load this in we'll do another hit all right loaded
up on the dyno Dino's ready to go in second gear again let's do another
pull knock is gone
stop the log still see an 18 and 1 half up top
had a little bit more on tip end though see if it picked up any power all
right so that one was 312 horsepower so we literally lost one horsepower by going back to factory refueling now what
does that mean to me so we lost one horsepower but the knock went away the
truck seems to be just as happy so there's no sense in me having the truck leaned way out like what trucks with
more mods would want when in this application it actually doesn't give a so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to pull just a touch of timing back out I'm going to leave the fueling right where it's at and that's where
it's going to ride so as we saw the 20 horsepower difference between second and third gear
this thing would have made roughly 335 to 340 horsepower which it actually
made it actually made 333 but that's without weather correction factor because it's literally uh 35 degrees in
here right now like I don't know if you can see it's cold in here so that's the
downside of running a Dyno is in the winter time is doors open exhaust fans on you know but either way that's going
to wrap it up for this truck hope you guys learned some things if you have any questions let me know I'll be I'm G to
definitely be going through more video ideas we're going to talk about some Diagnostics using the scanner like being
able to find misfires that a misfire counter wouldn't see we're going to go through a bunch of videos like that so
subscribe if you want to see some more but this truck right here I'm going to make those last little subtle changes
I'm not going to do any more pulls I'm going to take it out on the street drive it make sure it drives good I'm going to go back over my entire tune and make
sure I didn't you know finger anything you know BAS
so double check it since I am on camera I'm going to go ahead on and make sure that the end result is exactly what the
what we want the customer to have so appreciate the support guys and I will see yall in the next one

You said:
hey guys richard holder here
welcome to the channel today's question
what are cams worth
on a gen 5 5.3 liter l83 and more
importantly
which kind of guy are you stage one
stage two stage three stage four
which guy are you in this video we're
gonna find out how much a
cam upgrade is worth on a 5.3 liter gen
5
l83 we tested stages one through four
from brian to erasing stage one stage
two stays three stage four
and we tested intake manifolds we did an
l86
6.2 liter intake manifold upgrade
compared to the 5.3 liter l83 intake
manifold
and not just on one cam we did it on
multiple cams so how much was the intake
worth
how much were the cams worth there's
only one way to find out
let's get going
[Music]
[Music]
Engine Specs
okay guys what do you think that motor
sounds pretty impressive i love the way
that they sound on the dyno
but we need to find out how much cams
are worth to get things started so we
had our 5.3 liter
l83 btr has a ton of them if you guys
are looking for 5.3 liters they got a
bunch of
brand new crate motors available this
was one of them
used as a test motor this thing made 405
horsepower
and 436 foot-pounds of torque you might
be asking yourself but richard they're
not rated of that kind of power
they're not and here's why they make
this much power first of all
they're rated differently whether you
run them on gasoline and e85 obviously
the e85 rating is higher
e85 makes more power it allows you to
run more timing which they did from the
factory
this particular motor also had long tube
headers
and a good three inch exhaust with
mufflers
it also had no accessories on it it had
an external
electric water pump flowing water
through the motor so no accessories um
it also had obviously
james for short tuning was doing the
tune so it had an optimized tune to
maximize the power
both in terms of air fuel timing and cam
timing which is very important
so it had an optimized tune no
accessories a good exhaust
obviously the air intake was also good
and it was run at about 155 or so
degrees so
usually lower than we do uh run
on the in when it's in the vehicle
usually the temperatures are much hotter
than that and
as i said we ran it on e85 so all of
that going for it
that run with a what brian thule racing
calls a dod delete cam
which is basically the factory specs but
it allows you to get rid of the heavy
dod lifters and run the cam without the
dod
so again 405 horsepower 436 foot pounds
Performance
of torque i really like how broad the
torque curve is
on these factory vvt motors this gen 5
stuff is really impressive
has high compression it has vvt it has
really good head flow
and it has a good intake manifold so
there's a lot of stuff going for it so
this thing is a lot more powerful than
your garden variety gen 3 or gen 4 or
5.3 liter
but that's not to say that they don't
respond to cam timing especially when
you retain the vvt stuff
which again allows you to have a broad
curve so let's take a look at the
different stages from brian tooley
racing
here is their stage one cam and the
thing that i want you to notice first of
all
even from a mild stage one cam we went
from 405 or 406 horsepower
all the way up to 439 so it's a gain of
33 horsepower
obviously it allows you to rev the motor
up farther the peak
torque was up as well as we would expect
459 foot pounds
which is a lot of torque for a 5.3 liter
and knows
note that even down all the way down to
2500 rpm
there was no loss in low speed power but
remember
the critical point of all this is you
have to have a good tuner
if you have a tuner that can optimize
this combination
you can get all of the power from it but
it's just as easy to lose power if the
tune is not correct because you've got
three things that you have to adjust air
fill timing and cam timing and all that
stuff is super critical
so the stage one cam worked very well it
made good power
and this is an interesting thing when we
went to the stage
one two three four cams on the 5.3 liter
you could take a look at that videos up
on the gen 3 and gen 4 stuff
there starts to be a fairly sizable
trade-off in torque down low for the
gains up top
the vbt helps kind of eliminate that but
let's take a look let's take a look now
at the stage 2 cam
and we could see that the stage 2 cam
did pick up power and interestingly
enough it
kind of picked up power everywhere even
compared to the stage 1 cam so there
were no losses
it was better than the state better than
the stock cam everywhere basically
uh peak torque was up to a whopping 460
foot pounds
so just a little bit over the stage one
cam
the peak power out of the top as we
would expect was a bit better 448
yeah 448 horsepower so the stage two
a little bit better than the stage one
and with no losses down low so normally
when i'm talking about guys wanting a
4-8 or a 5-3
and the different stage truck cams that
brian thule offers for the gen 3 and gen
4 stuff
i like to put them in the smaller ones
so that they don't have the trade-off
unless they're going to put a converter
in
but for these things it looks like that
there's no loss
so maybe the bigger cam is the stage 2
is definitely the way to go
but let's find out what happened when we
ran when they ran the stage 3.
again stage 3 more power
was up to 455 horsepower
peak torque was you know kind of all but
unchanged was 458 foot pounds of torque
so you're
again you're kind of splitting hairs
there there was a slight
maybe a slight loss in torque but again
you're you're juggling
two or three or four foot pounds of
torque it's not really very much
i'm gonna zoom in on that once we step
up to the stage four cam
so now let's take a look at the final
one which is the stage 4
truck or the stage 4 l83 cam
and you can see there's a sizeable gain
there the the stage 4
is 479 horsepower and
peak torque is kind of right even with
the others 456 or 457
foot-pounds so it's all kind of in that
range but it shifted out a little
farther
now there was a loss and what i'm going
to do here is
try to zoom in and we can kind of see
well let's get a better let's get a
little bit better zoom than that
we can kind of zoom in in the important
area we can see the blue is still the
factory one you can see everybody is
above that but
this lighter green is the stage 3 cam or
the stage 4 cam
and it is down a little bit compared to
the others it's looking like the stage 2
is kind of the best one
but even in zoomed in this looks like a
lot more than it is but we're talking
about
416. so we're talking about 10 foot
pounds down there so again it always
comes down to
where do you want your power production
and the other thing that's very
important to note is that on the stage 4
cam
it will require notching the piston now
when i say notching you actually don't
need a valve notch tool and this might
be another video i'll do with brian
he's telling me that all you have to do
basically is knock a very small edge off
the big dome part of the factory
l83 piston so it's something you could
do if you pulled the heads you could do
with a motor in the car
because you don't need a specific valve
cutting tool it's not that you need to
put a pocket and a piston
all you need to do is knock this small
portion down on that factory l83 piston
and away you go then you can install the
stage four cam otherwise
stages one through three fit with the
stock available piston and valve
clearance now let's take a look at some
Intake
intake tests now that we've taken a look
at the power gains offered by the stages
one through four
cams after by branchley racing for the
l83 let's take a look and see what
happens when we upgrade the intake going
from the factory l83 intake
up to the larger 6.2 liter l86 intake
manifold
now this was our combination this is our
5.3 liter l83
it has slightly different camshaft in it
it actually had a 6.2 liter
l86 or lt1 dod delete cam so it's the
stock cam profile
but getting rid of the displacement on
demand and
for your information if you put an lt1
or an l86 camshaft
in your 5.3 liter l83 it definitely
picks up power it will be a power
upgrade
but equipped with that camshaft our 5.3
liter produced
438 horsepower 460 foot-pounds of torque
with the l83 intake now here's what
happened when we installed the l86
intake manifold it did pick up power
from about 4 000 on up
it picked up a little bit of power the
peak power was up to 445
horsepower peak torque was up to 466
foot pounds as you can see it lost
no torque even all the way down 2500 but
this was with a fairly mild camshaft in
it so the l86 is a decent upgrade
now let's take a look and see what
happens when we test this on something
that has even more cam timing in it the
Stage 3 Cam
next comparison between the
l83 5.3 air intake and the 6.2 liter l86
intake came on
our 5.3 liter l83 but it was equipped
with the btr
stage 3 camshaft which made 455
horsepower
and 458 foot-pounds of torque with the
stock 5.3 liter l83 intake manifold and
throttle body
here's what happened when we upgraded to
or the guys from btr upgraded to the l86
intake manifold and throttle body
you can see it did pick up power peak
power was up to 466
horsepower peak torque was up to 464
foot pounds of torque and as you can see
it gained power from
a little less than 4 000 maybe 3 900
all the way out didn't lose any power
although it looks like
maybe all the way down below 2600
there may be a slight change in power
down there
but basically gains like we saw with the
milder combination even with a stage 3
cam and it looks like the gains are a
little bit more
with more cam timing which we kind of
would expect from intake manifold as we
go up in power the
better intake gets worth to be more and
more power so now let's take a look at
maybe a stage four
Stage 4 Cam
the final comparison between the l83 and
the l86 intake manifold on our 5.3 liter
l83
came with the stage 4 cam which was the
biggest of the cams the one that
required you notching the piston to fit
it did make the most power run with a
stage 4 cam
and the l83 intake this combination made
479 horsepower
and 457 foot-pounds of torque
with the l83 intake manifold and here's
what happened and this is a
perfect example of why you need to
continue to test and test and test and
test all these combinations
because sometimes you find different
results now we would expect with this
bigger cam
that the gains to be even greater with
the l86 intake manifold
but here's what happened
so we take a look at the gains offered
by the l86 intake manifold on this stage
four cam we see that it did indeed
improve power peak power was
up to 486hp
peak torque was up to 461 foot-pounds
but as you can see the gains were not as
pronounced
with this bigger cam as they were on
this
on the two previous smaller cams so
again that's why it's important to test
so if you're expecting big gains
from your intake manifold choice you
have to make sure possibly to team it
with the right camshaft
let's get to our conclusion okay guys
Conclusions
what's the takeaway from
our cam and intake testing on the gen 5
5.3 liter l83 first of all these respond
very well to cams just like the previous
gen 3 and gen 4 ls stuff
the lt5 responds very well to the cams
but it
have to be the right cams and the
awesome thing is all these cams retained
vvt which was kind of cool to be
involved in that testing watch the guys
from brian tully racing
go after these vvt cams because it's
hard to get big gains from a motor
that's already working
very well and as we saw in the other
video where i compared the
gen 3 and gen 4 5.3 liter versus the gen
5
5.3 liter the gen 5 motor is head and
shoulders above
all of those and part of the reason for
that is the vbt cam timing so if you
make
better cams better vvt cams not only can
you make more peak power
but you can make a ton more average
power and not lose anything down low and
that's what everybody wants we basically
want
all the torque down low and all the
power up top the other interesting thing
was the intake manifolds the l86 intake
manifold is definitely an upgrade
compared to the factory
5.3 liter l83 intake manifold but
your gains may vary i'm richard holder
make sure to like share subscribe ring
the bell
do all that stuff more and more gen 4
gen 5 and all kinds of other testing
coming up
You said:
we're live it's uh it's even before 7. it's 6 58 officially pizza pizza staying on
niner what's up guys tonight we are going to talk about hopefully a couple things one of them is a video that i just posted up
with the cam testing on the 5.3 liter gen 5 l83 which is really
really cool because this thing started out very powerful especially if you compare it to a gen 3
or a gen 4 motor so the thing started out very very effective right off the bat because it
has lots of good things going for it and i was uh and brian thule and i
they're the guys that did the um those are the cams that we use we use stages one through four for the l83
and brian and i have been talking about this for a long time since way back when i first ran my 383 and even before that because we were
talking about how the fact of about how good they are and how and he was concerned that it might be really
difficult to get cams that are going to make uh either are going to make a lot more
power than stock or he was also worried when they first started going into development from the testing
that he'd done on some of the other manufacture stuff is that they you can get a power gain but it's such a
big trade-off and other stuff so they worked very hard obviously to do what they you know they do what they do
and they were able to make some pretty impressive power the thing that i like is that they're able to get gains and
these things are making impressive power numbers with mild cam timing
and i like the fact that the vvt allows it to like have really good power down low and at
the top and obviously in the middle if you look at the specific torque outputs of some of these things it's they're pretty impressive now obviously
the l83 has high compression has really good cylinder heads it's got a good intake manifold
it's got direct injection it's got a lot of stuff going for it that also help enhance that specific output but
the camshaft is a big part of it and as we see from that particular test if you guys haven't taken a look at the videos
you should if you see from that test there are still gains to be had and again just like with the ls that's because
they already have all of these other things they already have compression as a matter of fact more compression than an
lm7 and then the lc9 or the l33 more compression than that
much bigger better flowing heads than any of the cathedral port stuff
they have uh let's see compression and they have cylinder head they've got a really good intake manifold that i'm
sure is every bit as good as the truck manifold or the trailblazer ss and then obviously the direct injection
which kind of allows the compression and um they they respond really well they work
very well on the 85 which we ran all this testing on in fact chevrolet all but recommends you do that
by giving people two different power levels two different power ratings that they rate that they got
it's like 355 and 380 and so anybody that sees the higher number i don't know if you're anything like me
i definitely want that higher number so if you can run it on the 85 obvious obviously it's able to do that and that's what we did
in the testing which worked out really good so stages one through four or one through three
can go in with the factory available piston valve clearance and i'm sure you guys know that
the l83 of all of the gen 5 motors has the least amount of piston to valve clearance
so the the bigger ones the l86 and the lt1 the 6.2 liter stuff has you can put
bigger cams in them and that's unfortunate for the 5.3 although it is smaller and so maybe it
will use it it will want smaller cams and judging by the amount of power that we got the in that testing with those cams
there's plenty of power to be had especially with the exhaust kings what's up all cams are turbo cams my stock cam and
my five-way shirt as well with a 70 millimeter turbo you can run boost with a stock cam we've done that many many times
uh the thing that's interesting if you haven't tried it yet exhaust kings um if you add a camshaft
to that thing if you have a stock ho cam in it and you add a camshaft really at this point almost
any camshaft any of the alphabet cams in any of the small cams obviously the extreme energy 274 cam but
even something smaller than that you would pick up a lot of power at the same boost level so
that's something to think about but the stock cam idle's nice and having a turbo just adds more power so i can see and and i i
especially noticed this after we ran turbos on so many of the stock ls motors like we
ran them on the four eight and five three and the six oh and when you run it on a stock motor it's nice the thing idles
like a stock motor does it's like whisper quiet it it has everything going for it and then
it just makes like a gob of torque and a gob of horsepower so the stock stuff there's definitely
something to be said for that um so the la3 has the least amount of piston valve clearance
but i got a question for you here's a little uh i don't know a little quiz or a little
survey how many people would be willing to take the heads off and machine the valve relief and the
the interesting thing is on the l83 is you don't actually have to use a valve notching tool
uh according to brian the where the valve would hit the piston is not you don't need a valve pocket
there even though in some of the videos i showed a valve pocket that piston that i showed with the valve pocket it actually was an
lt1 or an l86 but on the 5.3 all you have to do is um grind off a little bit of the biggest
part of the of the dome on the 5.3 piston and you have to get rid of very much of it
just the valve just you know just barely doesn't clear it so you can get rid of some of it so how many of you guys would be willing to
do that take the heads off and and machine that so that you could put that stage 4 cam in there
and i i think that that's something i might think about if i'm going to talk to brian about doing a big bang on one of these motors
probably mine will be the sacrificial one but since we take it apart to put um
a ring gap in it anyway i think why not trim a little bit of
that off do a video and show you guys how to do that how little that you have to take off we'll mark it maybe and show you
like what i was thinking about is we'll mark it with clay and then mark it with a sharpie so you can clean it all up and mark it with sharpie
so you can see how much you have to take off uh brian's telling me that you could just do it with a dremel or anything that it's not
that it's not hard at all so that will be interesting and then then um you know we do what we do on
these big bang motors maybe do ported heads on it and judging by the fact that this thing already made like
513 with the stage 4 cam which again is not very big and the msd intake and it's running all
the way out to 7000 which would help us with not making a really big torque number i think we'd want to get away
from that i and and looking at the rods and stuff on the the gen 5 the only thing i don't know about are
the pistons i don't know about the strength on the piston so it'd be interesting to see but i would like to find out
um i want to do more testing on the fuel system with the gen five stuff before we jump
into a big bang one because i i don't want to i don't want to run out of fuel and if we only did like an lt4 pump and an lt4
injector and then more feed and then more cam lobe i don't think that's going to get us to where this motor can go when we go
under boost so i'll have to figure out some other fueling for it
so what are you guys doing uh make sure to go watch the video make sure to like we got 20 likes and 60
people watching come on everybody step up i guess everybody must be out on a friday night maybe i'm the only one that goes online
and talks to people let's see exhaust kings i'm going to do
a cam when i swap my 351 that would be good a 351 is definitely going to want camshaft i mean the stock cam
in a 351 is as mild as the ho cam in fact if it came from a truck it's probably
smaller than the h0 cam
will a 58x engine start and misfire with the 24 x ecu or would it not start i don't know
that it will start at all mason i've never tried that on a factory ecu i know that when we have the
holley not configured properly for for the um the trigger wheel on the crank that it
won't start
83 mustang 5-0 that that is og stuff that's back when they first started the 80 was the 83 the
157 or the 175 horse one
do you think a stage 2 btr turbo cam is too much for daily driving no it's not too big although i would recommend the and it
depends on what size motor you have if you have a 4-8 i wouldn't put that in there i would put a stage one even a five three i'd put a stage one in
because you it's not gonna the stage one or the stage two is not gonna determine how much power you make if you have a
turbo the turbo is gonna do that yes i do we do wanna do more fuel systems on the l83 we need to get the
potential up for the you know we need to get the fuel flow up and even if we have to augment it with
port injection which we can do
one of uh stuff and junk one of the ways that i've done it in the past is when we need to clearance one like on
some of the big bang motors i just go in there and just do a dremel and then we vacuum and and blow everything out it's obviously a
lot easier when the motor's sitting on the stand um but the other way we'll do it is i'll use a dremel and then we'll use a vacuum
while i'm using the dremel and we'll usually try to cover everything with a plastic bag and then
tape it down so that all we're seeing is the one thing that we're working on and then i'll use a vacuum and as the chips are going the vacuum
actually sucks the chips up you're still gonna have to blow it out and stuff but that gets like 95 of the stuff and
then you can blow out the rest of it uh a little off topic but let's get some
more buick 45 stuff there's more 50 more buick 455 stuff coming
uh trubio richard will you do a test on what horsepower lost on running accessories versus none
um take a look at the video that's already up actually i did i did all the accessories test
yeah dr differential that's a lot going on i think that we can get there with we have um obviously we can the
injectors are in the head so we can put an intake manifold that hot that has a port injection on it already
we can get that from holley um or we can make make our own i mean there are a lot of ways to go there
so if we augment it with port ejection it's just going to take some tuning to make sure that it's going to work right
uh truvio that that video is already up i showed back to back what the what and not just all the accessories
what one of the accessories does what each one of them do actually
tim says he's got 130 dollars on his wallet send me a working 5 3 gen 3 on monday you see you want to buy a working 5'3
for 130
you're not uh stuffing junk you're not you're not licensed to operate a vacuum cleaner you're not checked out on that it says
write in the thing that do not use heavy machinery do not operate heavy machinery
i i'm hydrating enough
what size fuel injectors do you recommend for a twin turbo 5.3 liter twin 76's what what 76's are they are
they like cx racing 76's or they like you know s475 kind of 76's um
what what's the power output you're looking for that will determine what the fuel injectors are
tim i'm i'm still lost what what are you talking about
my 5-0 motor was from a 92 thunderbird okay and that's a that's an h01
for only made 3000 of them it's very similar to the 95 mustang
yeah the intake's different on the t-bird because of hood clearance right
so if you want 900 horsepower and you have the twins that you were talking about
what are you going to run on e85 if you're gonna run on e85 then you're gonna need something bigger than 80s like a thousand ccs we run all the way
up to 1500 if you're gonna go over a thousand it gives you room to spare with uh e85
what's a way you can add port injection to the l83 i think that um who was it neither guateny or crawford
or one of those guys has some sort of piggyback deal that you can get from them to work with the factory ecu to to
augment it with port injection you jim you could run 80s but you can't
you can't really get to a thousand horsepower with 80s and e85 that's that's stretching them like to the limit
it seems odd on friday night there's only 77 people watching that seems weird
exhausting you know you don't have to keep throwing my money at it man good luck on your project let me know if
you have any questions man i'll help out
so mike my other question is how many of you guys would be willing to
take the motor apart and actually machine the lift not machine them but but clearance the pistons in order to
put the bigger cam in if you guys saw the video you know how much power additional power the stage 4 cam
is it's a it's a pretty good jump so is that something that you would go through to put um to be able to put that
cam shaft in
uh what what are you calling me the yeah the channel is richard so
that's fine for a genuine coyote what size injectors
would you use for e85 and cams for n a stuff uh and any you're going to be looking at
let's say that you were sizing your objective for 600 horsepower that's probably not going to do that
unless you really get after with ported heads and an intake manifold on a gen 1 coyote but let's say you size them for 600
horsepower um i don't know what the coyote stuff come with
16. yeah see that's really only a 37 pound injector so 40s would work fine
40s or 42s or 45s would be more than enough and i i think i would go more than 37s i
would go like 45s or 50s that way you could run e85 on it
the weather is beautiful out here it's actually pretty warm
no you're cutting a piston won't mess with the balance of the rotating cylinder first of all you're cutting all of them so they should be even right
and really the amount that you're cutting off is next to nothing
you yeah you have to pull the head to get rid of the afm lifters so be willing to drill the pistons if i knew you for
sure it was safe yeah and again if you're just careful with covering everything and then vacuuming it and blowing it out and stuff
it's all gonna be fine uh stefan junk you don't have to worry
about the balance removal we do that stuff all the time
no balance is not an issue nick
302 brodex track one solid roller 250 850 that's a good size cam
with 10 pounds of boost yeah that will work fine
yeah robert if you're going to take it apart for ring gap and you're going to be adding boost to it that's a perfect opportunity to machine the piston
how big can you make the lifter board why do you want to make the lifter bar bigger you want to put different lifters in
uh gothic i actually don't know which one had a bigger difference between intake and exhaust profile
what's the rod saving zone in the timing map it's gonna be near the torque peak is the
where you're most concerned and below you don't want to have much
timing below that either if you pull the pistons you don't have
to change the bearings we just reuse them especially on a low mileage motor like that
we reuse stuff that has two or three hundred thousand miles so so the gen five stuff is not gonna
have anywhere near that much camshafts are backordered for nine weeks
man
one last question uh if you're you're if you have a transmission question i'm not the guy to ask about that
i can simba i can usually uh if it has a co2 solenoid it should also be
able to operate manually
what is the big chunk next to the intake valve on the 416 valve i think it's a swirl vane
bigger lifter boards with tom you're saying bigger lifter boards would allow for off-center position
an off-center position of the of the lifter how is that going to
add piston to valve clearance
uh tim if that question is directed at me we check bearing clearances whenever we build the motor
i don't ever check bearing clearances on a junkyard motor and i i don't ever remember having a set
that were bad that we just replaced but i i certainly would
jonathan the thing that affects it the way that the engine sounds is um exhaust duration primarily
how much power can i make with sneakier one thousands well it depends on how much um static pressure you have and how much
operating pressure you have if you if you're going for a rising rate regulator and you're you know you have
you have the same delta let's say you have 60 psi and if you're doing oh on e85 on the 85
it's going to be it's going to be near a thousand horsepower
so here's a question um what do you guys think would be the uh two questions really
what do you think that the limit would be what is the limiting thing on the gen 5 motor if we're going to do a big bang
on it um obviously we'll put head studs in and it'll have mls gaskets on it it'll have the
the gen 4 or the gen 5 rods paul what's up you need to come come in with a question man if you're going to come up with 15 bucks
and paul's stepping up which we like uh then ask a question but if we have a gen 5 what do you guys
think that the limiting factor will be if we try to do a big bang on it will it be the fuel system will it be the piston
design will it be the connecting rod will for some reason would it be the crankshaft
um is it the block uh let me know what you guys think
i think the extreme energy 274 and the trick flower almost identical nick
uh tom can you really change the lifter position to that much to have a
change i mean basically what you're trying to do is effectively change the rod the rod length basically by angling the
uh by angling the push rod but can you really change it that much i mean how off center can you get that thing
uh almost racing you can but i can't remember uh god it's been so long since we did
any of those um i think there was a reason for people to leave that on there that might be a good question for me to ask brian tooley
ta did some a lot of uh two valve heads for me back in the day i i'll have to ask him if that swirl
bait needs to stay in there
what kind of cam shaft do you want to see made for the gen 5 uh i think that there's a lot of good stuff
out there already right so you think of the rods we'll let go
and then the injectors of course
when you do a big bang would it be would it be good to run under load for a few hours no when do you ever run a motor at 1500
horsepower for a few hours um and a stock motor that was designed to make
you know less than 400 that's a that's an endurance test that's a different [Music]
thing oh phil so he's he's running low
sevens i would i don't know what mile an hour that's going to equate to and i don't know his weight is but that's obvious he's obviously making
power but if you switch over to port ejection that makes life easier and that's that's one of our considerations
mustang crazy rich crack rods and he don't care it's a good song it's catchy
and tom if you move it by 60 thousands how much will that change pissing the valve
like five or ten thousands maybe
we need a 6.2 liter in a big bang you won't you won't do that it won't break it
won't break n a it's not making enough power
port injected gen 5 versus gen 4 power differences that yeah that would be interesting to see i'd like to see what
kind of power we could make running the um gen 5 with only
port injection i'm going to ask james at btr if they can do that
the camshaft does dry the fuel pump with a lifter yep
now i'm excited about doing the um i would i want to do some turbo testing with the typical lt4 stuff
first but i'm excited about maybe doing a big bang on that thing as long as we can get the
fuel system right
[Music] uh mika yeah there this is it's normally
seven o'clock at night is when we do it seven o'clock pacific standard time
how's everyone doing for georgia and you know snakes georgia is it would be a good place to go look for sinks you guys got there's a lot of good stuff back there
uh most stuff i've been catching are rattlesnakes which i don't don't care for as much
yeah phil that would make sense 1500
is there a way to know if a cam will pull enough vacuum for brakes before purchasing you kind of have to deal with a
manufacturer on that if you give them your displacement um your static compression
they can um give you probably a pretty good idea
jake wants to test motocraft variable venturi carburetors and i haven't seen one of those in a long time my stepdad had one of those on
his bronco uh dj that's a good question i don't
know what the flow rate is of the l83di injectors um i think that the guys from
lincoln filter had all of that stuff up but i haven't looked at it for a really long time
uh the plunger has a limit to how much basically how much cam load
you can put on it but so there is a limit there but we would use a combination probably of the
two is what i'm thinking because i don't think you could get i mean i well we can't afford to put enough enough
injector in there i'm sure they'd be enough pump and injector because i'm sure those would be
really really expensive now most guys are probably not going to do that most guys would go the cheaper route and the cheaper route
probably would be to add port injection to it
yeah kevin take a look at the video and thank you very much but uh the same thing happens to a 5.7 hemi
when you don't have any oil as every other motor if you look at the video that we did when i was doing this up with chad
where we ran the motor a wide open throttle and went out and pulled the drain plug out of it and all the oil came out it lasted 91
seconds at wide open throttle under full load so that's actually a pretty long time
a gen 5 short block with a gen 3 4 head test i i don't know how easily that would bolt
on
uh jonathan i'd expect you to talk to somebody a lot more educated than i am about the harmonics
of that stuff um a lot of the external stuff is done so that you have um adjustability which works good
and then um you want uh like
the what were the guys in the i'm trying to think of oh the crate trigger stuff is really really good um because then
you don't have the attachment between the camshaft driving the distributor
so that you have a much better um timing but that's ignition timing so
all you're trying to do is get precision in there so so you don't have slop and if you look at any ls motor they all every chain that i've
ever checked whether it's brand new or has a 100 200 300 000 miles on it they all have a ton of slop in them and i think that
that's why i think i was told that gm did that so that they could um so it's easy to install everything so
it goes on really easy but i don't know if that's true but then they went to the
the guide on the ls2 stuff and then the tensioner on the ls3 stuff because they're trying to take that slack out so getting slack out would be
a good idea so that'd be one of the reasons why you would go to you know a gear to gear thing or
hydro chains double roller timing chains belt drives
but the harmonics thing i don't know i'd have to look into that and see i would like to put the 4.2 liter in the
nova uh mustang crazy we have a big aeromotor brushless pump that we use on the dyno
when we're doing fuel injection otherwise they have two big carbureted fuel pumps also [Music]
brandon i haven't run the l8t yet i do want to do that because that's a kind of a cool motor
that would definitely be other guys that would be other guys gen 5 motor
any plans on testing the gen 5 btr truck cams the l83 cams are basically that
and that video is up
you can change the change the clearance by the piston to valve clearance by 60 thousandths by moving the lifter 60
thousandths that doesn't seem right you're not changing the angle of the push rod that much
will an xc284h and a 496 behave similar to an xc274
and a 454 uh yeah that probably would be close
no i don't think it would seem like it's bigger than the 274 is on a 454.
the tom the exhaust valve timing is not what we're concerned with we're concerned with the intake valve
timing on the gen 5.
the elaine lt5 cam specs 551 524 or 200 207
what sort of issue can you see for an l83 nothing that cam would go in you just need springs for that for that lift
but that count wouldn't have be a problem that cam is similar to the um that cam is actually similar to
the um lt1 i need to look at see
let me look up some cam specs here [Music]
i can tell you what's going on
yeah the l86 dod delete cam is a 200 207
so that's real comparable to that so the lt5 cam is is not going to be
[Music] not going to be dramatically different than an lt1
i don't know what the lsa is though on the lt5 cam i would imagine it's fairly wide
dennis at torque cam that btr torque cam works really good in a 48
what valve lift is the stage four cam
have uh i don't let's see
i think that the stage 4 cam is over [Music]
600.
brandon the lt1 and the l83 and the l86 all have direct injection but the lt5
actually has both the the big fancy supercharged motor has both
thoughts on the lincoln filter gt12 cam i i don't know what the specs are on that camera and i've never tested it but trick flow 205 heads on a
5 3 are always a win best mile cam for a third gen ls1 uh
i don't know what best mild cam means just tell me how much power you want to
make
you
yeah you'll like the torque and we've even run lots of boost on a torque cam on a 48 it works pretty well
uh jv when we run something like that an ls2 with ported 243s and the head
head scam intake and all that stuff it normally wants uh 29 degrees of total timing at the
horsepower peak but we run it fairly cold so you might not be able to do that in the car
uh humongous 227 235 50 614 621
yes that that cam will work good on a 5.3 it's going to make power at the top of the rpm range but
especially with the 205 head and i'm hoping that you have a fast intake manifold on that or at least a
trailblazer ss
if you want to make spunky do you want to make 400 wheel horsepower or 400 flywheel horsepower because 400
flywheel horsepower any camshaft in an ls1 is going to get you that
okay 102 yeah that you're going to be doing just fine with that cam that's going to be like the the um
comp the 450 4 cam that's a 227 that's got more exasteration
227 243 i think if i remember right but it's going to be like that that one will actually be a little bit
better uh down low and then lose just a little bit at the top probably compared to that comp kim
can you give me an idea of canon springs you use for the lt5
um you should talk to brian tooley about that there they have brian has one of those and they've run some stuff on the
dyno with it and so he probably would give you a better idea
okay so you want 400 wheel horsepower you want 500 horsepower from a 5.7 that's not too hard
and now now nick i can't remember what you had in terms of what your other things were if it 243
243 heads are going to be a little bit hard to do that with but um so you need a pretty good sized
camshaft and the one that we were just talking about that uh the lingenfelder gt2 gt12 cam
or the comp 54-454-11 um that's a 227 243 and that probably
would get you near that power level with a ls1
joey you have a super heavy 2017 silverado 37 inch tires two wheel drive gen 5 427
texas speed mix 900 on pump and methanol is it a got a blower or something on it i don't
think that that makes 900 pump and methanol n a right so it's got
some kind of blower on it if it does then a 342 gear probably would be fine although that's a pretty tall tire
any behind-the-scenes info info on the comp llc turbo cam it worked good i i don't know i mean you
saw what the dyno results were that's that's what i provide is i just do a back-to-back test and tell you what
happened [Music] uh josh yeah and and
this is a question that i get a lot just a general cam question if the heads are using are done gaining fluid for
450 to 500 lift like for instance a vortech head of vortex small block chevy
head would it be beneficial to keep the cam around 500 lift for valve train stability
the valve train stability has nothing to do with what the head flow is doing um and you can run more lift in the
camshaft and the head and you'll still gain power even if the head flow levels off and even if it
starts going down past that lift number so like if you stall at 450 and
500 and it goes down at 550 you can still gain power from running a 550 lift
cam because the thing is you've you've added a whole another section of flow and it's only at 550 once during
while it's opening and closing but now you've added another 500 number on the other side of it so
you've gained like average flow and that and that works it doesn't work all the time but
it but it can work so there are a lot of guys that that's a that's a hard and fast rule for them oh
this thing only flows to 550 lift i only need a 550 lift cam and that's that's not true
uh perry that's not a lot of camshaft for a 383 so if you 450 crank horsepower is going to need a
decent head if you you know an airflow research enforcer or is kind of the low buck approach um or a
pro max or skip white those kind of things or the trick flow super 23 head works really good too
i'm looking for every day for my lq4 seven ported seven ninety nines
sixty four twenty a sixty five hundred pound twenty five hundred so you're gonna want
something small like a stage two truck cam probably would work good for that
woodies
we have a twin ls1 mud truck does that mean there are two ls ones in the mud truck or is it a twin
turbo ls1 in the mud truck running 38 inch paddle staying on top of the mud takes a thousand horsepower
um you must be slinging a lot of mud though 2000 if you're down in the mud that stuff gets really gets really
really heavy and and if you want tire speed to stay on top of it you're moving a lot of mud that
takes a lot of power
the shaft mount rocker george is not going to add any power if you test it on the motors that we normally run like a junkyard one
you might see something at really high rpm um you might not there might just be stability there
uh perry a 1 6 rocker might help but just make sure that you have enough valve spring to try that sometimes that
that gains it and sometimes it doesn't
you you would be better off if is the 270h a magnum cam you'd be better off with an extreme
energy cam profile
jeffrey the low shock technology thing is uh the the service finish that they're
doing is really nice but they're also trying to make the cam more stable something i'm sure that they learned on the
spintron um and typically when you make the cam more stable you also will trade power
but it's a trade i would be willing to make and every all of the other cam guys that have spintrons like brian
tully um they they know this and and you can get you can get real aggressive on the
ramp rates and you can have it make more power but the problem is it like kills parts if you do that and so that's not a good
trade-off if you have a camshaft that only lasts 5 000 miles it kills something either a valve or a lifter which is
pretty common um or the camshaft itself that's it doesn't matter that there's an
extra eight or ten horsepower if it just destroys itself
plans for a procharged gen 5 la3 uh we could do that i'd rather do turbos
but a procharged one would work as long as we can get the fueling requirements
uh dustin i actually don't like that sloppy stage 2 cam i i think in a an lq4 it'd be better
than it is in a five three and a four eight um because then you you you might get away without having to put a converter
in it in a six liter but that camp definitely needs a converter in a four eight and i i would argue that it also
needs one in a five three
cool so it is a dual motor thing that's pretty cool tom
boosted dad has a gen 3 ls a texas speed dumpster fire cam and ts dual springs 1000 cc snake
heaters 320 liter per hour pump ebay gt45
uh elaine the the the motor did have um phaser limiters in it but
in the small cams that they're running other than the stage four um they're probably not necessary
uh boosted 500 wheel horsepower is pretty easy with that gt45 turbo
an fy uh bradley and f1a94 will support 1200 we've done that before we've done i think we've done 1300 with
it on a big block
and it and it will work good for a street engine just just know that like every centrifugal blower it'll have
a rising boost curve so it won't have a lot of boost down at 3000 rpm and i don't know how high you're revving it
but at 6 500 let's say um or 7 000 then it will have its maximum boost up there
uh texas speed stage 2 cam would work on the lq4 yep
the btr stuff is fun it's always good to get back and see brian even if i wasn't going back there and doing videos and we
weren't doing dyna testing i would go back there and see him because he he's just good people and the rest of the guys back there especially in the
dino area are just awesome
uh dr differential a thousand cc injectors not a problem on a [Music]
it's better if it's you're doing it on e85 just because you would flow be flowing more fuel
but you should be able to idle that down i doubt i don't remember what size the motor was that you were doing that on but
if it's the bigger the motor is the better because the more fuel you're supplying
the truck is called the hillbilly bootlegger turbo ls one with the bootlegger cams
so the bootlegger the lenati ones the la nadi bootlegger cams
josh we we talked about that actually the guys from bardstown bourbon were were saying that they could make it make
a lot more this is just the first batch of stuff that they gave to them so they they know that they can go to the 190
level um like everclear is because we i've run that not run it in a car but we've sampled it before
uh what turbo would you recommend for a cam53 uh grant how much power do you want to make you're you're looking at a 7875
probably if you're trying to make a lot of power or an s475 i wouldn't put a t6 on it
though for that application
is it worth walnut blasting a 75 000 mile gen 5 lt1 that shows no drivability
issues um no you you shouldn't have to do that
75 000 miles is a little bit but if the thing runs and runs good then you can um run some of the cleaner
stuff down lucas has some and there's lots of different guys that have it so you can just spray that stuff in the intake and
foam it and get get the if you want to try to get the build up off the valve if there is any
brandon i don't know what the overbore capability is on the gen 5 stuff
i'm rebuilding a 5.3 gen 3 for my o2 silverado i'm looking at a btr stage 2
with long tube headers no cats will just ruin the drivability for daily
driver and towing uh i myself for a 5.3 i would put a gen
i would put a stage one one in there but lots of guys like the stage two stuff
eraser d you can tell how good your cam is by looking in the intake manifold i think he's talking about the build up
in there but if you look at any ls manifold even even a stock one
which has obviously you know has no overlap it's filled with oil that's part of the
pcv mr bull have you ever done a test on ls3 intake test with a btr
102 intake and ran up to 8000 a couple things there there would be no
comparison between an ls3 intake and the btr short runner intake they're
designed for completely different things the ls3 intake is designed for like a 6500 rpm
power range that's where it's going to be have optimized power production the short runner btr manifold is way
above that so that you would use them for different things if you were running an ls3 manifold up to 8000 you wouldn't be making any power
it's it's way on the fall off side for that runner length and and conversely if you're running a
btr intake and you want to run it at 3000 rpm it's going to be way down compared to a fast manifold because it's
the wrong rpm for that manifold
yeah josh sampling 190 proof like everclear stuff is not
it's not something people continue to do i don't think they continue to do that and stay around very long
uh tim what's tight about the aluminum gen 5 blocks is it the bearing clearance is really tight on
them or or the piston to wall clearance what's what gets tight on
uh grant you can actually step down the three inch um just smash it and put a t4 flange on
it it's not gonna hurt anything
uh woody's i'll put my email address down there for the paypal thing it's not necessary obviously i'm happy to
answer your questions let's see make sure i take my caps off
yes that is correct there you go
do we think 155 proof moonshine well fascist pendant that's what this was that we tested it was between 155 and
160. um and it doesn't compare to e85 and it doesn't it wouldn't compare to it under boost because it's making way less power
um and it's using a lot more fuel so we need you need to get get rid of the water and i think i think going up
toward the 190 level would would make it better
tom i haven't even got one of the dodges yet from the from the wrecking yard there's so many other motors that have to get done first mr bull what's up
oh oh the liners are tight okay so is that are those aluminum motor motors more like the ls1 and ls2 and ls3
that we just can't overboard they're not like a l33
simple mods has been thinking about push rods and v-tech i like it i like where this is going
if the tablet was inside the sliding sleeve tap would run the lobe and sliding
sleeves could ride the outer vtec lobe locking them both together for engagement just whip
that up really quick and get it running and let's see if it works rex what's going on
friday night doesn't seem to be a very good night for the um for people watching this i think that this is the lowest number we've seen
where where's everybody at are they all out partying are they like hopefully they're all out working on their cars that's what i'm hoping
uh linwood the gm still sells small bunch heavy crate motors so they're they're still around
yeah it is good weather out there it's beautiful outside uh woody's that's much appreciated there
there are lots of guys who will come and and you know not partake
they'll come and just take i know it's nice that the restrictions
are going away and lisa and i have gone out and you know you actually get to go out to in a restaurant and all that's it's nice
that that's going away my boys are both playing sports and stuff so it's kind of cool
mr bull let me know what happens when you guys go on the dyno
is there any difference in potential max power using e85 versus c16 i would say yes because the c16
has much higher octane but i don't i don't really i'm not difficult but it doesn't have
the cooling and it doesn't make as much power at the same boost level as e85 so i
guess the answer is i'm not sure
the thing that i want to compare and i haven't overlaid it yet i'm thinking of doing a video on it is we we made um
[Music] i've made 500 horsepower a little more than 500 horsepower with the heads cam
and intake five three lm7 style motor and the now the gen five is made over
500 with it obviously has a good head already so it has a benefit has more compression
but with a cam and intake so i wanna and i haven't overlaid those yet to see how they compare to see if one has like if
the particular the gen five is gonna have a lot more average torque production but it'll be interesting to see and and
talk about what it takes to get 500 out of each one of those excuse me nothing about nothing about me
thank you very much get yourself a frosty beverage for all there's nothing better than a frosty cold beverage
except having one with my wife lisa oh is it buffering
are there going to be any boost coming soon for the gen 5 motors i hope so we're just trying to work out the fuel fuel system richard just bought an lm7
swapped f body after tapping rings should i do any upgrades to the 706 valve train before turboing yeah do you i'm hoping that you have a
cam some kind of camshaft in there and if you do you should have valve springs too at least some sort of beehive upgrade or
a dual spring
tim actually when i was there brian the guys from brian thule racing had already ordered an lt2 intake
manifold it wasn't available when i was there for the test but they are going to test that to find
out how it compares
uh nick there's a is it possible to spin a centrifugal supercharger and control it with a boost controller instead of having a rising boost curve
you're not going to control it with a boost controller um the the way that they do it is they over speed the blower so it
spins the heck out of it and then they'll bleed off stuff at the top
so they'll regulate the boost and the only thing that will happen is like you have a rising boost curve and what
they're trying to do is is there you're going to elevate the whole boost curve so it's going to come up a little bit
sooner but it's not at all like it's not anything anywhere near like a turbo does
you can improve it but you can't make it do what a turbo does or what a positive displacement blower does
jeffrey take a look at the turbo exhaust video that i have up that should give you a pretty good idea of the
changes in power tom what ls combo will give you 500 foot
pounds and 500 horsepower n a it it had to be a big one
have you done or know of any testing of 4032 and 26 q8 pistons what is it 26 q8
chris we did test the msd intake on the gen 5 and it worked well i mean it works well in the top because it's a short runner deal
and also holly has a high ram that has um a setup for port injection for the gen 5 as well
rigged in jimmy garage can you run 11.9 static compression with an 8.8 dynamic compression on 91 octane well
the dynamic compression is not the thing that's going to determine whether or not that's going to detonate it's not the only thing there are a lot of things
that are going to determine whether that if you if you soften the chamber you could probably
get away with more than that you could probably get away with a higher dynamic if you take timing out of it you can easily run it on 91
but then it's not really going to make a whole bunch of power so the a lot of guys live and live and die
by this dynamic compression thing and they don't realize that that's i mean the air temperature can change it the water temperature can change it
the shape of the chamber the shape of the piston hot spots bad fuel all kinds of things can change
whether or not that's going to work or
not yeah tim for us we're not gonna run um we're not gonna run a big bore on the
um l83 we would just run at stock anyways um but can guys put the four inch cranks
in the l and the gen fives uh fascist pendant the variable speed
stuff the guys from pro charger did that so they have a like an internal box a step a step ratio basically and that
works okay and they can they have it so that it's kind of computer controlled i was never able to test one of those we
asked them a number of times but i was never able to do that but it was a fairly small blower that they had it attached to
uh gray i think that they ran factory lifters i think that they got rid of the dod lifters and put the standard lifters
in yes the rising boost curve can be
beneficial on the street for traction and driveline savior
yeah i don't chris if you're talking about the alloys in the forging i thought that that's what the 4032 was i didn't know what the other one was i
didn't realize it was a typo but um the only way it would be much easier to test those from a
metallurgical standpoint do a do a breakage test or a stress test than it would be to run them both
on the on the motor um i'd have to find out what the expansion rates are on both of those to find out if they
need this different you know again here's another issue is it if the expansion rate's different then you put different piston to wall
clearance in then they have different amounts of blow-by and you know it's a whole thing
uh cranking compression is also not an indicator of detonation
i take that back it's an indicator but it's not it's not the whole thing
uh grant sometimes we see nothing when we go from a t6 to a t4 i have that test that video up and it
depends on where you are in the range of the turbo relative to the range of the flow rate
of the exhaust of the hot side so when we went from a t6 to t4 we just essentially saw no change at all
uh mr bull that sounds like a good combination how do i get over 300 horsepower out of
a 1988 iraq z28 5.7 uh that should only be a cam uh
you know you have to you should have headers on it um you could do some stuff to the error inlet on it but that motor was rated at 240 what
i don't know what year it is 1988 so the thing is probably only rated at 2 30
or 2 35 i think um might not be able to get that with just a cam
better heads would definitely do it do you have iron heads on that
or do you have the l98 heads on it a little bit of parting on the l98 heads would help
the cvt transmission is kind of what the lookup lookup procharger you can see what they did
uh great i don't know if the i don't know if they share that if they share the same lifter i have to talk to brian
about that brandon you need to stop asking the same [Music]
question
uh eraser how much cranking compression do i need to light off e85 or methanol
i don't know that there's an absolute number for that we've run e85 on really low compression
stuff with big cams and high compression stuff with bigger cams and
and the ignition system is working good it lights up just fine
uh jared we got um we did testing on the l86 when i was back with brian
they did l86 stuff and lt1 stuff i'm going to be putting the lt1 stuff on
up on the thing so that we did because the difference between the l2 and l86 they're the same motor they just have a
different intake manifold on them so we ran different um camshafts on that they ran ported heads on it they ran
different cams obviously in that and they even machined the pistons and stuff too so it all worked out good
why would i never run methanol with less than 235 psi of cranking compression i i'm not the
guy to ask about methanol having never run it on anything other than when mahovitz was there um but i don't know why
you you would i don't know why the crank because you can get cranking compression out of lots of different combinations of
camshaft and static compression and if you're running methanol you don't want to have a mild cam in it
well i need a stall converter if i put a stage 2 cam and l83 i don't think so i i the stage 2 that we
tested i i think you're fine i mean that none of those lost power compared to the stock cam
jason talk to the guys at btr you have a 408 with a trick flow gen x 225 head that's good
take a look at the six liter test i have up or the 408 test i have up that has the airflow research heads on it
which would probably be a little bit better than those 225s but we ran four different camshafts in
that 408 and it had a fast manifold on it so it was a good combination you could kind of see what well i mean i think that that thing made
625 or something like that but that was probably a 459 or a 469 cam
the this simple mods the stuff that we think about when i get together with guys like brian
the stuff that we would like to test and then decide that we shouldn't spend the next two weeks on testing
something just because we would want to know the answer and it would not benefit us in any way shape or form um there's a lot of
cool stuff like one i can tell you one of them was
that because westack has two dinos everybody is asked and this is the way sae did a lot of their testing so people
want to know well how much loss is there from running the turbo on one so we were going to duck the piping all the
way from one dyno or at least this was my idea duck the piping from one dino cell all the way
over into the other one to run the boost on the other motor that would be the same to 5.3 liters
and so that way we could run the motor and find out how much losses we could run them in a and then we could run them boosted and run them boosted with
one feeding the other one and but okay well what is what is i don't know 20 or 30 foot
length of pipe you know how much does that take away so that's a whole new thing i wanted to do
for fun but uh the guys the guys at west tech were like yeah i don't think that that's probably going to work
uh last question jay j mav any suggestions on the camera single turbo 70 millimeter five three pulling a
trailer yeah the torque cam actually works really well for that application um anything small stage one truck cam
uh tom i have been offered lots of jobs actually but i'm not doing that anymore
uh great we did run talk injectors so i gotta get going guys thank you all for showing up i'll be back tomorrow
interesting i'm i'm gonna have to take a look i'm going to take a look back through the history of the live feeds and see which days are
better than others and maybe we need to maybe we need to think about limiting them if um you know people are not going
to show up you know i feel slighted i could be out i could be out the bars
not that i would be there uh thanks for showing up guys i will see you all
tomorrow

hey guys richard holden here
welcome to the channel today we're
talking about gen 5 l83
5.3 liter performance and after finding
out how much power these things can
really make
the gen 3 and gen 4 ls stuff is dead to
me
not really okay guys how do we coax over
500 horsepower from a gen
5 5.3 liter l83 that's what this video
is
all about the amazing thing is how
little it took to push one of these 5.3
liters
over the 500 horsepower mark so what did
it take
let's find out but before we do that
let's take a listen let's hear one of
these motors
up on the dyno let's make some noise
Noise
[Music]
so
Power
before i can run our modified version of
our l83 5.3 liter and try to make 500
horsepower we obviously have to run a
stock l83 5.3 liter and find out how
much power we're starting with and
that's exactly what this is
only kind of this one actually has a
couple of changes to it other than stock
now we all know that when
we when gm rates their stock 5.3 liter
l83 in fact it has a dual
rating one based on gasoline and the
other one based on e85 so that right
there is going to change the power
before we even get started but the
factory rating is actually rated the way
that the motor is
in the car it's not rated at the tire
it's rated at the flywheel
but it's rated with all of the
accessories run with the factory tune
run with a complete exhaust system run
with a complete air intake system
so basically the way that the thing
appears in the car the way that you are
going to run it
that's the power rating now the nice
thing is on this l83 this direct
injected motor
they have two different ratings one for
if you were going to run it on gas
and the other running on e85 now we know
e85 can add power
in our testing i haven't seen a great
deal of power change on the n a motors
comparing 91 to e85 but when we run 91
when we run at west tech we normally run
cold water so we're able to run
all the timing basically on 91.
a lot of times you can't do that if
you're running the motor in the car at
temperature with a hotter charge
temperature
or a hotter air inlet temperature so e85
can you can benefit from e85 because
then you can run more timing if you have
to run
23 or 24 degrees of timing and you can
bump that up where the motor wants to
make peak power which is going to be 28
or 29 degrees
you can then pick up power so in uh for
gm
they originally rate this l83 at 355
horsepower
and 383 foot-pounds when you run it on
gas
now the rating jumps up to 380
horsepower
and 416 foot-pounds when you run it on
e85 because we're able to make more
power with the e85 sometimes by itself
and then you're actually able to run
more timing which they do in that
combination
so we ran this l83 stock
and when i say stock it's not really
stock
everything on it is original including
the throttle body the intake the
cylinder heads the short block all of
that stuff
this was run with long tube headers when
i did my test previously you can take a
look at that video it's up right now
i did a comparison of the stock exhaust
manifolds versus long tube headers and
we didn't see
much of a gain but this one did have
long tube headers on it
it also does not have the factory
accessories run on it
so it has a an electric water pump
that external in this case because we
ran this at brian tooley racing
and it's external so it's pumping the
water through it's not driving all the
accessories
it also has headers and no cats so it
has a different exhaust
it obviously also has an optimized tune
and it's also run on e85 so we kind of
have the best situation for this and
that's why it made this kind of power
level
now again it was rated at 380 the way
that gm does
with all of those things i mentioned but
run on the dyno at bryan tooley racing
this is a stock motor with headers on it
that made
405.5 so 406 horsepower
torque was way up there at 300 or 436
foot-pounds the other thing i need to
mention is this cam was run with
what brian truly calls their dod delete
so it's a stock
53 l83 cam but
the lobes have been changed to not work
with the dod the big heavy dod lifters
basically it has all of the stock same
lobes on it so
it makes the roughly the same power as
the stock cam
it just allows you to delete the dod
which a lot of guys want to do
anyway but as you can see it makes
awesome power and to put this number
into perspective
here's what a stock gen 3
or gen 4 uh l83
or or the stock alum 7 makes that we
that we run all the time and this is
actually a fairly good
lm7 this was with uh this was a five
three with 706 heads and the stock cam
shaft and the stock compression there's
a stock uh manual throttle body it was
run with headers kind of in the same
manner that we run this l83 with but as
you can see it makes a lot
less power and a lot less power
everywhere we can thank a couple of
things
on this combination i'm comparing these
two the la3 makes more power
because it has a number of good things
going for one has more compression it's
11 to 1 versus nine and a half to one
it has a cylinder head that that has it
has a bigger port
um it flows a lot more it has a slightly
smaller it has a smaller chamber than
the 706 head
so it's got a lot of good things going
for it and i think that the intake
on the l83 is probably every bit as good
or maybe even better than the stock
truck intake manifold
so the and the big thing is the vbt cam
so
it has a cam specs that are probably
similar
but being able to vary the cam works
very very well
so we can pick up power down low it can
pick up power up top
by advancing and retarding the cam shaft
and they do that and
what that does is produce a broader
power curve so the
the l83 compared to the gen 3 and gen
453 is just head and shoulders better
um but now this is our starting point so
let's find out how we get from here
a little over 400 horsepower to over 500
horsepower
on the l83 now that we understand how
good the stock
5.3 liter l83 is let's figure out how to
make it even better
and obviously because this la-3 has
really good cylinder heads it has a good
intake manifold it's got plenty of
compression
and we're not going to stick a stroker
combination into up to displacement it
has enough displacement
the first thing that we want to look at
just like with the gen 3 or gen 4 ls
is a camshaft now it already has a vvt
camshaft in it which works pretty well
but let's face it it's a stock vvt
cam and if we want to make big power
numbers we're going to have to step up
and camshaft
and that's what exactly what the guys
from brian thule racing did
they've got a number of these crate
motors and i'm going to show you some
stuff at the end you if you guys are
looking to buy one they've got a ton of
these
l83 crate motors which would be really
cool in some some sort of project car
especially if you put together one of
these that made this kind of power i
mean a 500 horsepower motor
in almost anything is going to be a lot
of fun the other thing that could happen
is you could combine that kind of power
output
with some kind of power adder obviously
and make it even better but let's figure
out how to make this thing make more
power
right now we're at 405 or 6 horsepower
and 430
foot pounds the first thing that they
did was
install a stage four yeah
why because it's one better than a stage
three
yep it does make lots and lots of power
but there is a price here
we take a look at this stage 4 cam from
brian thule racing the power output
jumped to 479
horsepower 478.6 peak torque was up as
well
to 456.5 so we're gonna call that 457
foot pounds and the thing that i want
you to look at is this
these runs were started at least with a
stock cam all the way down at
near 2000 rpm now this one started at 25
or 2600
right in the area where you're kind of
starting to see a little bit of loss
between the stage four
and the stock cam so it's pretty
impressive even all the way down there
and again this is a stage four cam so
this is the top of the line basically
probably until they come out with a
stage five for the 5.3 liter l83 stuff
and as you can see
it gained torque kind of everywhere from
below
3000 so 2800 or so all the way up so
maybe a little bit of a stall converter
in this thing
there is one downside to this camshaft
because the 5.3 liter l83
has 11 to 1 compression like the other
bigger motors the bigger 6.2 liter stuff
that required a bigger uh dome on the
piston
so the 5.3 there actually has the least
amount of
available piston to valve clearance of
any of the lt families
so this particular camshaft even though
it's not very big
relatively speaking it still required
the motor to be taken apart
and the pistons to be clearanced so that
you could have the available piston
valve clearance necessary for this
camshaft which is only about 219
to 221 degrees of duration at 50 on the
intake side which is where which is what
is going to hit on this combination
so you could step down to a stage 3 cam
and i'm doing a video on that we're
going to compare the stage 1 stage 2
stage 3
and even the factory l86 cam
or and lt1 cam on this 5.3 liter because
that's actually a fairly good upgrade as
well
along with a variety of different intake
manifolds run on all of those camshafts
because the thing is when you upgrade
the intake manifold from
an l83 to an l86 you're going to pick up
power
but the amount of power that you pick up
varies with what kind of camshaft you
have in it so there's no universal thing
so it is kind of cool stuff i'm
doing a big video on that and that will
probably come out next but
on this combination it was required to
notch the piston you can step down to an
l83
obviously the power will be down and
we'll go over all that in the next video
but as you can see we're not quite to
500 horsepower
so how do we get to 500 horsepower do we
need to go up in displacement do we need
to port the head
no the only thing that we need to do is
change the intake manifold
but just like the trade-off here in
having to notch the valves
with this stage 4 cam there's also a
trade-off in intake manifold as we know
when you go down and runner length when
you put a short runner intake manifold
on there it typically picks up power
at the top end and then the trade-off is
power down in the lower and middle part
of the curve and that's exactly what
happened
we installed an msd the air force
intake manifold on it and picked up a
lot of power take a look the peak power
this is what allowed us to bring this
5.3 liter over 500 horsepower 513
horsepower
peak torque on this combination was
actually down compared to the long
runner
down to 444 foot foot-pounds so the
trade-off below
5300 or so is a slight loss in torque
from the msd but a big change in power
out on the big end so if you're going to
read this thing and by the way this
thing also had a valve spring upgrade on
it
to allow for these camshafts and this
rpm range
the thing that i like about this is it
still has a pretty broad torque curve
and it's up near 450 foot-pounds
it's over 400 foot-pounds from
about 3000 rpm all the way out to 6800
rpm
so that's a really broad torque curve
and this thing might be really cool
since we're running it all the way up to
7000 rpm
if you match this with a centrifugal
blower that would be really nice
obviously if you match this thing with a
turbo that would also be awesome
so there's no limit obviously to how
much power these things can make and
remember
these are with stock cylinder heads we
haven't even ported the cylinder heads
and this is with a very small cam
relatively speaking
i had to put some fairly big camshafts
in the gen 3 and gen 4 stuff
on a 5 3 as a matter of fact we had to
go to the absolute limit of available
piston to valve clearance
and with with seriously ported heads and
a really really good intake to get these
things to make
over 500 horsepower on a gen 3 or gen 4
motor
and this thing did it with a cam and an
intake manifold so obviously the factory
heads flow really well
we can make them flow even better which
might be a test for another day so make
sure
let's get to our conclusion but before
we do if you're looking for this kind of
power those guys have some crate motors
you can get one from the wrecking yard
do this cam and intake manifold upgrade
if you're interested in obviously they
can hook you up with that
now let's get to our conclusion okay
Takeaway
guys what's our takeaway in this little
adventure testing the gen
5 5.3 liter la3 well two things first of
all
this thing started out very very good i
mean take a look at the comparison
between the gen 5 motor and a gen 3 or
gen 4 5.3 layer
and we can see the gen 5 motor isn't
just better on the top or on the bottom
it's basically better
everywhere throughout the entire rpm
range we have a lot of things to thank
for that obviously
higher compression better head flow it
has a good intake manifold and
it has variable cam which works very
well to broaden the power curve so it
starts out better
and what that means is it's going to be
easier for us to get to
any given power level with modifications
and this gen 5 responds very well
all it took was the right cam shaft and
intake manifold to push this thing
over the 500 horsepower mark and we
didn't just exceed it by a little bit it
didn't just make 501 or 502
it made 512 or 513 horse
horsepower so exceeded the 500 mark by
quite a bit
but and this is very very important
remember we did have to machine the
piston to get the available piston to
valve clearance to run this stage 4 cam
if you don't want to do that stick the
stage 3 in and away you go
the other thing is we had to put the msd
intake manifold on it which sacrificed
power
down low to get that big peak number on
the top and the final thing and this is
ultra critical
make sure that your tuner knows what
he's doing to get the most out of these
combinations with
variable cam your tuner has to be spot
on
you can miss by a whole bunch and lose
all of the power
of the camshaft if you do not tune it
properly
armature holder make sure to like share
subscribe ring the bell do all that
stuff
more gen 5 testing coming up  and thanks for taking such detailed notes for summaries and such and coumenting all this great information!!!! 

You said:
hey guys richard holder here
welcome to the channel i've got a
question for you which one makes more
power
a 500 horsepower 5.3 liter lm7
gen 3 motor or a 500 horsepower
5.3 liter l83 gen 5 motor
is that a silly question let's find out
in this video we're going to take a look
at a comparison between a gen 3
5.3 liter lm7 both in stock and modified
trim and we're going to compare that to
a gen 5 5.3 liter l83
also in stock and modified trim and
guess what both of these motors in
modified trim
made over 500 horsepower they also made
exactly the same peak torque number but
guess what the power curves
couldn't be more different i'll show you
what i mean
before we can get going in our
comparison between an lm7 and an l83
we need to take a look at what they did
in stock trim and then take a look at
what they did in modify trim i have
another video up
already kind of comparing them in stock
trim and also compared to a 6 liter lq4
which makes an interesting comparison
between the 5.3 liter l83 and the larger
six liter
but i never got to compare these in
modified trim because until now
i hadn't run any modified versions of
the l83 but this is kind of cool so
we're going to take a look at
two 500 horsepower modified versions but
before we can do that
we need to take a look at both these
motors in stock trim
and also i want to show you what each
one of the modifications did to these
individual motors starting with the lm7
so
we have a stock lm7 that i got from the
wrecking yard
all that we did we do the things that we
normally do on these things we
took it apart because we were going to
be running boost on this i put ring gap
in it
we just did the razor blade rebuild on
the heads and stuff
and on the deck surface we put new head
gaskets on it we put headstuds on it
because again we were going to be
running boosts
but before we do anything we ran it in
stock trim that meant stock
throttle body or a stock size manual
throttle body because sometimes we have
to replace them
if we get a late enough motor where we
have the drive by wire stuff
if we get something that's later than
2002
so stock throttle bikes truck intake
stock 706 or 862 heads
all the stock bottom men and this being
an lm7 it had the dish piston in it
it has the stock camshaft we did run it
with long tube headers in this case
these were inch and seven heights they
make about the same power with an inch
and three quarter
on this on this stock five three because
they're just not very powerful
we ran uh long tube headers and
collector extensions
we optimized the tune with the holley hp
management system and had no accessories
we run the mode or a little colder and
as i said with an optimized tune that's
why it makes more power
this way that we test it than it does
when it's rated by the factory which is
a completely different
test parameter so run in stock trim
in this manner on the engine dyno made
354.5
horsepower and 381 foot-pounds and these
range when i get them from the wrecking
yard depending on how well they've been
taken care of and
how much blow by they have and you know
how how many miles and all that
they could range from 300 and mid 40s or
so up to up to something like this 355
or so so they're all kind of in this
range and the torque output will range
from 307
to 3 all the way up to 383 but they're
kind of in that 10 horsepower 10 foot
pound range now i want to show you
before we compare it to the lm7 or to
the l83
let's take a look and see what we did on
the when we modified this version
so this was our modified lm7 that made
over 500 horsepower
503 horsepower peak torque was
up to 443 foot pounds of torque yeah
442.7
and you'll note that most of the gains
from the modifications came
after 4 000 rpm there wasn't a big drop
below that but there weren't any
significant gains below that this
modified combination was the stock
bottom end in fact this this one was the
basis for our big bang
5.3 beer that we made 1300 horsepower
with with the stock bottom in
but to get it to make power we augmented
the top end of it
the first thing we did was obviously put
a cam shaft in it this one
was was a comp
uh 281 lrr which is the
this one was the 54 that's 459-11 cam so
it was a 6 17 6 24 lift split
a 231 239 degree duration split and 113
degree lobe separation angle
this also had a set of cnc ported trick
flow 215 heads on so
very very good heads for this
combination they flow a ton we
they can support another hundred
horsepower above this
if we had enough motor to do so so there
were more than enough cylinder head for
this combination
we also had a fast lx lsxrt intake
manifold and 102
two millimeter throttle body so with
those changes
the power output jumped to over 500
horsepower so now let's take a look at a
comparison between the lm7
and the l83 but before we do that we'll
look at the l83
stock and modified then we can compare
the two
now that we've taken a look at the 5.3
liter lm7 it's time to take a look at
the gen
5 5.3 liter l83 and like with the
lm7 we ran this both in stock trim and
in modified version where this thing
exceeded 500 horsepower so we're going
to take a look at that
we ran this motor stock on the dyno at
westec the interesting thing is
running this motor at west tech
and then the guys from brian julie
racing also ran one out at their place
on a different dyno with a different
tuner and all that completely different
the interesting thing is these the two
uh motors those two power curves overlay
exactly i mean they're within one or two
horsepower everywhere so we know a
couple things first of all
that these motors are very repeatable
but even run at different dyno places
with different tuners and different
temperatures and all kinds of stuff
there's lots and lots of repeatability
here because this is what they do
so we ran this motor with long tube
headers with a
modified version of the stock air intake
obviously the tune was optimized and we
ran this at about 150
or so degrees and this thing ran good i
mean it did
what we expect of these l83s and the
impressive thing is how much torque they
make
this thing made 405 horsepower
432 foot-pounds of torque and over 400
foot-pounds i'm all the way down past
3000 rpm so this thing did very well
and the interesting thing is to get
these motors to make
more than 500 horsepower
this is what the curve looked like this
combination made 513 horsepower
and 444 foot pounds of torque so it did
very well
but this was with uh the only changes
that we made we had the stock cylinder
heads
obviously the stock short block but it
was with a brian thule racing stage 4
cam now in order to fit that cam in
they did have to go in and massage the
dome on the piston a little bit
just to get the avail make sure that
they had enough piston to valve
clearance for this particular camshaft
they ran an msd intake manifold which is
interesting because the msd
is quite a bit shorter than either the
factory l83 or
l86 intake manifold so it'll be
interesting to compare
this combination with the short runner
manifold
compared to the relatively longer run or
fast manifold
run on the lm7 5.3 liter so these are
the power outputs for the stock and
modified version of the l83
now let's compare the 5.3 liter lm7 to
the 5.3 liter
l83 now that i've shown you a comparison
between the stock version the modified
version both of the 5.3 liter lm7 and
the 5.3 l83
let's compare the two and see how those
two compare
this is our stock 5.3 their lm7 the gen
3 version
and here's how it compares to the stock
l83
and i've shown this before in another
video and we've shown it a couple of
times actually and you can see that the
5.3 liter l83 just
basically makes more power everywhere
it's everything that the
lm7 is just more of it basically and not
surprisingly it has better cylinder
heads
it has more static compression it has um
every bit as good an intake manifold and
the really the thing that really helps
it and we'll see this
when we look at the modified versions
the variable cam timing obviously helps
us quite a bit so
the combination between the two i mean
we're looking at a difference of
going from 353 or 4 horsepower
355 horsepower up to 405 horsepower so
it's a 50 horsepower jump and torque
kind of took a similar jump it was
it's impressive 381 foot pounds
432 foot pounds so i mean who doesn't
want an extra 50 horsepower
and 50 foot pounds and it's not just 50
horsepower and 50 foot pounds at the
peak
it's basically 50 foot-pounds kind of
everywhere through the curve so
the 5.3 liter la3 should be a much
better
you know truck motor unless the new
truck is a whole bunch heavier but
that's another story now let's take a
look at our modified versions
it's not surprising given the years of
technology that the gen 5 l83 would be
better than the gen 3 or gen 4
5.3 liter now in truth we did not test a
gen
3 or a gen 4 version of the 5.3 here so
it may fare a little bit better
with you know maybe an l33 or something
it has a little bit better camshaft it
has a 243 head
and a flat top piston and the
trailblazer ss manifold so it may bridge
the gap between those two so
for you gen 4 guys i haven't forgotten
about you
but it's not going to make 50 horsepower
it's not going to be 50 horsepower
better
um here is our modified version of the
lm7 and it made over 500 horsepower
which is good it made 503 or 4. yeah 503
horsepower
and 443 foot-pounds of torque from a
peak
power standpoint it did very well let's
take a look at
how this compares to the 500 horsepower
version
of the l83 and the la3 squeaked out a
little bit more at the top
from about 5500 to 6000 they were
exactly the same
the modified version of the l83 made 513
horsepower so it was up about 10
at the top the peak torque numbers were
very very
close um peak torque 442 foot-pounds
and then if i remember right yeah 400
and yeah they were both at 443 so they
almost made
identical peak torque numbers but if we
take a look
at the rest of the curve we kind of see
the real story here
as impressive as the modified um
the 5.3 liter lm7 would be and it is we
know we made a ton of power with i mean
weight 1300 with
turbos on it take a look at all of this
stuff down at the bottom so from
40 600 or 4700 rpm
down low i mean for instance down here
at 3400
we have 362 versus 416 foot-pounds so
you have a dramatic difference in torque
production
and there are a couple things to
consider here one obviously
if we made our lm7 11-1
it's gonna pick up power basically
everywhere so we
we could elevate this whole curve by
going from nine and a half to one and
actually probably was
a little less than that given the
chamber size on the 215 head
so we could elevate this by six or eight
horsepower or so
um going up in compression going up
making making this thing eleven to one
but it's still not going to change the
torque down here and the reason for the
big change in torque down low below 4500
rpm i think is the vvt
cam cam timing because it's important to
note that the
l83 used stock heads the
the lm7 used fully ported cnc 215 heads
now those 215 heads will support
way more power than we're using here but
it required good ported heads to get
there
it also required more camshaft i mean if
you take a look at just the intake
duration specs
on the l83 versus this modified these
modified versions
the stage four cam for btr is somewhere
in the 220 range
and the camshaft that we use on the lm7
is like 232 so it's more than 230
degrees so that's
that's at least 10 degrees bigger on the
intake duration it
that was required to get us there i
think that the fast manifold
is a longer runner manifold certainly
than the msd is
but even though we had a short runner
version on the l83
that allowed us to make lots of peak
power the vvt
allowed us also to combine that with
more power down low now if we had a long
runner intake we'd have even more power
down low but we would trade power
at the top on the l83 so here is our
comparison our 500 horsepower version so
the question is now
which 500 horsepower version would you
rather have
obviously all of the guys that are
considering costs are going to say well
the
the gen 3 motor ultimately is probably
going to cost less
but would it since you don't have to buy
ported heads
um the well the manifolds are probably a
wash
the camshafts are probably a wash as
well although a lot of guys are
complaining about the cost for people to
put those in
but putting a camshaft yourself in an
l83 is actually not
terribly difficult so again which one
would you pick
let's get to our conclusion okay guys
what did we learn in our comparison
between the
gen 3 lm7 and the gen 5 l83 well the
first thing we learned is
maybe richard you should have used the
gen 4 motor but at the very least
the la3 is a worthy successor at the
very least
to the gen 3 and gen 4 stuff it
continues the tradition
it makes power and has plenty of power
potential even in stockish
trim i mean all it took was an intake
manifold and the right camshaft
to push this thing pretty far over the
500 horsepower mark and it took a lot
more effort obviously
to get the gen 3 motor up to the same
level
but here's my question to you guys i'm
hoping you guys will all make comments
about this
what about the gen 4 stuff and more
importantly what if we used vvt
on a gen 3 or gen 4 5.3 liter for
instance what if we took
an l33 or an lc9 an aluminum
flat top piston uh 5.3 liter and then
added vvt
the right vvt cam milled a good set of
heads like a 205 trick flow and put that
on
ran it with a good intake with variable
cam timing
so with the higher compression and
variable cam timing and the right
intake manifold and intake manifold
could the gen
4 meet or exceed
the gen 5. let me know in the comments
