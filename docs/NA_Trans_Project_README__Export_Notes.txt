NA Powertrain Tuning – Chat Export Notes

This ZIP contains:
- All project-related files available on disk under /mnt/data at the time of export.
- A text export of the model's persistent project memories (NA_Trans_Project_Memories_Export__2025-11-19.txt).

Limitations:
- I cannot directly export full ChatGPT conversation history as files.
- Only the current context and persistent memory summary are included.
- For full chat logs, you'll need to use the ChatGPT UI / account tools to download or copy them manually.

Use this ZIP as a portable snapshot of:
- Your reference PDFs (Transmission, Engine, Driveline, etc.).
- Transcripts and service notes.
- Shift/TCC table packs and slip-table packs.
- Pipeline READMEs and related docs.
- The memory export file summarizing all saved project context.
